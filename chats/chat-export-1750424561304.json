The key challenges include data sovereignty, computational resource sharing, and maintaining audit trails.\n> \n> ### Core Principles for Cross-Institution Agent Collaboration:\n> 1. **Federated Autonomy**: Agents operate within their home institution's security perimeter but can negotiate tasks across domains.\n> 2. **Sovereign Data Handling**: Raw data never leaves host institutions; only metadata or encrypted insights are shared.\n> 3. **Verifiable Provenance**: All cross-institutional actions recorded in a permissioned blockchain ledger.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ### Proposed Architecture: Federated Agent Mesh\n> ```mermaid\n> graph LR\n>     subgraph InstA[Pawsey]\n>         A1(Domain Expert) --> A2(Orchestrator)\n>         A3(Data Curator) -->|Secure Enclave| A4[(Local Data)]\n>     end\n> \n>     subgraph InstB[SKAO]\n>         B1(Signal Processing Agent) --> B2(Orchestrator)\n>         B3(Telescope Control) -->|TEE| B4[(Observation DB)]\n>     end\n> \n>     A2 <-->|Federated Task Protocol| B2\n> ```\n> \n> #### Key Components:\n> - **Institution Gateway**: Manages agent communication across firewalls using TLS 1.3+ with mutual authentication.\n> - **Task Marketplace**: Where agents publish/exchange capabilities (e.g., \"Pawsey-Agent #783 offers GPU-accelerated RFI mitigation\").\n> - **Homomorphic Encryption Layer**: For privacy-preserving computation on sensitive data (e.g., medical images).\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ### Collaboration Models\n> #### Model 1: Contract Net Protocol (CNP)\n> - **Process**:\n>   1. *Task Announcement*: Initiator agent broadcasts task requirements.\n>   2. *Bidding*: External agents respond with capabilities/costs.\n>   3. *Awarding*: Best bid selected via predefined rules (e.g., lowest latency).\n> - **Use Case**: Distributed radio astronomy calibration where SKAO agents bid on interferometry subtasks.\n> \n> #### Model 2: Federated Learning Swarm\n> - **Process**:\n>   1.
