The user is asking about Mark Stickells, the director of the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, speaking at the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 in Hamburg. Let me check the provided context.\n> \n> Looking at the context, there are three sources. The first source mentions Mark Stickells in relation to the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre and the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 in Hamburg. The name is listed in the 'name' attribute of the source tag with id=\"1\". The content inside the source tag is just \"Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre | Perth WA\". But the user is asking about a speech he gave at the conference. However, the actual content of the speech isn't in this source. \n> \n> The second source (id=\"2\") has two parts. The first part lists the program chairs and other committee members for ISC 2025. Mark Stickells isn't mentioned here. The second part of source id=\"2\" talks about the opening keynote by AMD's Mark Papermaster and mentions Scott Atchley as a guest speaker. Again, no mention of Mark Stickells here.\n> \n> So, the context does have references to Mark Stickells in relation to the conference and his affiliation with Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, but there's no actual content of his speech. The sources only mention his name in the metadata, not any details about his presentation or talk. The user might be expecting information about his speech, but the provided context doesn't include that. \n> \n> Since the task is to respond based on the context, I need to check if there's any explicit mention of his speech. The first source's name includes \"speech\" and \"conference presentation\", but the actual content doesn't have the speech details. The user's query is about finding material related to his speaking engagement. The context does show that he was part of the conference (since the source's name mentions his participation), but there's no further information. \n> \n> According to the guidelines, if the answer isn't present in the context but the user's knowledge exists, I should explain that and use my own knowledge. However, in this case, the context does mention Mark Stickells in relation to the conference, but doesn't provide details about his speech. So, I should inform the user that while the context references his involvement, there's no detailed material on his speech here. \n> \n> Wait, but the first source's name has \"Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre speech International Supercomputing Conference 2025\" which indicates that the source might be about his speech. However, the actual content inside the source tag is just the center's location. This could be an error in the context data. Since the user's task is to use the provided context, and the content doesn't include the speech text, I can only note that his name and affiliation are mentioned in relation to the conference, but no actual speech content is present. \n> \n> Therefore, the answer should state that the context mentions Mark Stickells in the context of ISC 2025, but the specific speech material isn't available here. Also, cite the source with id=\"1\" since that's where his name appears in the metadata.\n</details>\nThe provided context references Mark Stickells and his affiliation with the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in relation to the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 (ISC 2025) in Hamburg, Germany [1]. However, the materials included in the context do not contain the content of his speech or detailed agenda from the conference. The sources mention his name in metadata tags but do not provide transcripts, summaries, or specific topics discussed during his presentation. For further details about his talk, additional resources or direct conference proceedings would be required.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750048482,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching the web","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://pawsey.org.au/australias-setonix-ranking/","https://tca.glueup.com/en/event/quantum-industry-day-135066/","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://sc25.supercomputing.org/planning-committee/","https://www.facebook.com/pawseycentre/","https://www.hpcuserforum.com/"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-9008a9ef174af3b8a4e96b397f51dd0fb3e15246933d14441226","name":"Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre speech International Supercomputing Conference 2025, International Supercomputing Conference 2025 Hamburg Mark Stickells agenda, Mark Stickells conference presentation 2025 supercomputing","type":"web_search","urls":["https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://pawsey.org.au/australias-setonix-ranking/","https://tca.glueup.com/en/event/quantum-industry-day-135066/","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://sc25.supercomputing.org/planning-committee/","https://www.facebook.com/pawseycentre/","https://www.hpcuserforum.com/"],"queries":["Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre speech International Supercomputing Conference 2025","International Supercomputing Conference 2025 Hamburg Mark Stickells agenda","Mark Stickells conference presentation 2025 supercomputing"]},"document":["Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre | Perth WA","Program Chair \n\nTORSTEN HOEFLERProfessor of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProgram Deputy Chair \n\nROSA BADIAManager Workflows & Distributed Computing Group, BSC, Spain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAM CHAIR \n& DEPUTY \n\n\n\n“We look forward to seeing everyone interested in HPC and AI at the 40th edition of ISC.

They mentioned \"Also look at Linkedin\" after a previous request about Mark Stickells and the ISC 2025 conference. The user likely wants me to check LinkedIn for relevant information related to Mark Stickells' participation in the conference.\n> \n> Looking at the provided context, there are two sources with LinkedIn mentions. The first source [1] lists Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile and mentions his role as CEO at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. The second source [2] talks about the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre's LinkedIn updates, including a post about a deadline extension and another about ResBaz QLD with Emily Khan.\n> \n> The user wants information from LinkedIn specifically. The context includes LinkedIn URLs in the source names, but the actual content of the sources doesn't provide detailed information beyond what's already mentioned. The first source's content is about Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile, but the text doesn't describe his conference participation. The second source mentions a LinkedIn post about a deadline and an event in Queensland, which isn't directly related to the conference in Hamburg.\n> \n> I need to check if there's any mention of the ISC 2025 conference in Hamburg or Mark Stickells' speech there. The sources do reference ISC 2025 in their names, but the content doesn't elaborate on his speech or the conference highlights beyond the LinkedIn posts. Since the user wants info from LinkedIn, but the provided context's LinkedIn references don't include the needed details, I should inform them that the available LinkedIn data in the context isn't sufficient.\n> \n> Also, the user might be expecting me to access external LinkedIn data, but according to the guidelines, I can only use the provided context. Since the context doesn't have the necessary information, I need to state that the available LinkedIn materials in the context don't contain the specific details they're asking for and suggest checking LinkedIn directly or other sources for more information.\n</details>\nThe provided context includes LinkedIn references but does not contain explicit details about **Mark Stickells' speech at the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 (ISC 2025)** in Hamburg beyond mentions of his affiliation with the **Pawsey Supercomputing Centre** and the conference [1].

The user wants me to visit Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile directly to check for posts or articles about his ISC 2025 session. But wait, in the previous interactions, the user provided some context sources, but those were just snippets from LinkedIn, probably metadata or tags mentioning Mark Stickells and the conference.\n> \n> First, I need to recall the guidelines. The user emphasized that I can only use the provided context. I can't actually browse the internet or access LinkedIn directly. So, even though the user is asking to visit the LinkedIn profile, I can't perform that action. My knowledge is limited to the context given.\n> \n> Looking back at the context sources, there were mentions of Mark Stickells' LinkedIn posts related to ISC 2025, but the actual content of those posts wasn't included. The sources only had his name, title, and hashtags like #ISC25, but no detailed information about his session. So, based on the context provided, there's no specific information about his presentation at ISC 2025 beyond his involvement and affiliation.\n> \n> The user might be expecting me to simulate visiting LinkedIn, but since I can't do that, I need to inform them that the available context doesn't have the necessary details. I should also mention that the existing sources only reference his participation and the conference themes but not the content of his talk.\n> \n> I should make sure to explain that I can't access external websites and that my answer is based solely on the provided context. It's important to be clear and helpful, maybe suggesting they check LinkedIn directly or look for official conference materials if the information isn't here.\n</details>\nI cannot directly access external websites, including LinkedIn, to retrieve real-time updates or verify current posts about Mark Stickells' ISC 2025 session. My analysis is limited to the provided context, which includes metadata references to his LinkedIn profile and the conference but lacks specific details about his presentation content [1]. \n\nFor direct verification, you would need to:  \n1. Visit Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile manually to search for posts tagged with #ISC25 or related keywords.  \n2. Check the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's LinkedIn page for conference highlights or summaries mentioning his session.  \n\nIf no further context is available here, official ISC 2025 proceedings or recordings might also provide insights.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750049570,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching the web","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawseysupercomputing_ncris-adsn-teampawsey-activity-7271774740065738752-7gwn","https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-isc2025-hpc-activity-7339313057501728768-hd3H","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/pawsey-advances-genomic-research-with-amd-gpu-support-for-basecalling/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc/"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-ce7751510b2bce81dd41d36630934574ce3480ff8f33f71c2784","name":"Mark Stickells LinkedIn posts about International Supercomputing Conference 2025, Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation summary site:linkedin.com, Pawsey Supercomputing Centre LinkedIn ISC 2025 highlights featuring Mark Stickells","type":"web_search","urls":["https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawseysupercomputing_ncris-adsn-teampawsey-activity-7271774740065738752-7gwn","https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-isc2025-hpc-activity-7339313057501728768-hd3H","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/pawsey-advances-genomic-research-with-amd-gpu-support-for-basecalling/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc/"],"queries":["Mark Stickells LinkedIn posts about International Supercomputing Conference 2025","Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation summary site:linkedin.com","Pawsey Supercomputing Centre LinkedIn ISC 2025 highlights featuring Mark Stickells"]},"document":["#ISC25 -

We both offered our thanks to ISC and the organising teams behind WHPC for their efforts to support, engage and promote the community.\n \nMy closing points were to make a call for leaders to act in matters of diversity and inclusivity - not just for equity and ethical reasons but for competitive, business reasons, improving outcomes for all.\n\nI also looked ahead and invited colleagues to join us at SCAsia in Osaka next January - https://lnkd.in/gE9yhujw\n\nCristin Merritt Aditi Subramanya Jana Makar Emily Barker Linda McIver Karina Nunez\n#WHPCPlus #InclusionInTech #HPCAIcommunity #LeadershipMatters #Australasia #Supercomputing #DiversityInSTEM","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","start_index":26,"title":"#ISC25 - #ConnectingtheDots - #WHPC | Mark Stickells AM"},{"description":"#ISC2025 - #ConnectingtheDots - #HPCaroundtheworldAPAC\n\nAs the APAC Chair of the ISC High Performance theme “HPC Around the World” I had the privilege of opening a focused discussion on the Asia-Pacific region — one of the most dynamic yet uneven contributors to global HPC-AI. Here were some of my introductory comments to set the scene for regional updates from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan:\n\n——-\nAccording to Intersect https://lnkd.in/gBEKckEN) - APAC accounts for 24% of the global HPC-AI market, but capacity is highly concentrated and asymmetric, with major shares in China (~45%), and Japan (~25%) with the rest of APAC accounting for ~7% of global capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, HPC is becoming a smaller slice of the AI infrastructure landscape, as hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centres, and cloud-optimised platforms reshape the field. \n\nKey challenges raised in a recent HPC-AI Leadership Organization (HALO) study included rising tech protectionism and geopolitical friction, access bottlenecks for GPUs, accelerators, and interconnects; diverging architectures between traditional HPC and AI workloads, growing demands for data sovereignty and a critical talent shortage across HPC, AI and quantum.\n\nThe questions posed to our APAC leaders at #ISC25 included: \n\nHow do we stay sovereign, collaborative and competitive? Where do we partner — across nations, sectors and disciplines? How do we better engage industry — not just as users, but as strategic partners?\n\nWith sincere thanks to our regional HPC leaders who shared their perspectives - with your leadership the future of HPC-AI will be regionally engaged, collaborative, and purpose-driven.\n\n- China - Professor Yutong Lu, Director of the National Supercomputing Center in Guangzhou \n- India - Dr Shri Magesh Director General and Dr S D Sudarsan are senior leaders at India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)\n- Japan - Professor Satoshi Matsuoka,  Director of RIKEN’s Center for Computational Science \n- South Korea - Dr Ji-Hoon Kang,  Director of the Supercomputing Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI)\n- Singapore - Dr Terence Hung, Chief Executive of the National Supercomputing Centre\n- Taiwan - Dr Weicheng Huang,  Director of the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC)\n\nThe ISC team have made recordings of the ISC Invited Program available as complementary content to the broader community. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g7rfnK2T\n\nAddison Snell Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre National Computational Infrastructure\n\n#HPC #AI #AsiaPacific #DigitalInfrastructure #HALO #ISC2025 #DataSovereignty #TechLeadership #QuantumComputing #Supercomputing #GlobalCollaboration","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","start_index":26,"title":"#ISC2025 - #ConnectingtheDots - #HPCaroundtheworldAPAC | Mark Stickells AM"},{"description":"🎉 Pawsey Wrap of the Week: Celebrating Achievements, Building Connections, and Looking Ahead 🌟\n\nHere’s what Team Pawsey has been up to:\n\n🔹 Showcasing Learn@Pawsey at STAWA Future Science Conference 🧪\nFathima Imra Haseen and Victor Olet delivered an inspiring session to 45 educators at the Science Teachers Association of WA Future Science Conference at The University of Western Australia.

The first source mentions Mark Stickells in relation to the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre and the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 in Hamburg. The name is listed in the 'name' attribute of the source tag with id=\"1\". The content inside the source tag is just \"Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre | Perth WA\". But the user is asking about a speech he gave at the conference. However, the actual content of the speech isn't in this source. \n> \n> The second source (id=\"2\") has two parts. The first part lists the program chairs and other committee members for ISC 2025. Mark Stickells isn't mentioned here. The second part of source id=\"2\" talks about the opening keynote by AMD's Mark Papermaster and mentions Scott Atchley as a guest speaker. Again, no mention of Mark Stickells here.\n> \n> So, the context does have references to Mark Stickells in relation to the conference and his affiliation with Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, but there's no actual content of his speech. The sources only mention his name in the metadata, not any details about his presentation or talk. The user might be expecting information about his speech, but the provided context doesn't include that. \n> \n> Since the task is to respond based on the context, I need to check if there's any explicit mention of his speech. The first source's name includes \"speech\" and \"conference presentation\", but the actual content doesn't have the speech details.

The context does show that he was part of the conference (since the source's name mentions his participation), but there's no further information. \n> \n> According to the guidelines, if the answer isn't present in the context but the user's knowledge exists, I should explain that and use my own knowledge. However, in this case, the context does mention Mark Stickells in relation to the conference, but doesn't provide details about his speech. So, I should inform the user that while the context references his involvement, there's no detailed material on his speech here. \n> \n> Wait, but the first source's name has \"Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre speech International Supercomputing Conference 2025\" which indicates that the source might be about his speech. However, the actual content inside the source tag is just the center's location. This could be an error in the context data. Since the user's task is to use the provided context, and the content doesn't include the speech text, I can only note that his name and affiliation are mentioned in relation to the conference, but no actual speech content is present. \n> \n> Therefore, the answer should state that the context mentions Mark Stickells in the context of ISC 2025, but the specific speech material isn't available here. Also, cite the source with id=\"1\" since that's where his name appears in the metadata.\n</details>\nThe provided context references Mark Stickells and his affiliation with the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in relation to the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 (ISC 2025) in Hamburg, Germany [1].

Since the context doesn't have the necessary information, I need to state that the available LinkedIn materials in the context don't contain the specific details they're asking for and suggest checking LinkedIn directly or other sources for more information.\n</details>\nThe provided context includes LinkedIn references but does not contain explicit details about **Mark Stickells' speech at the International Supercomputing Conference 2025 (ISC 2025)** in Hamburg beyond mentions of his affiliation with the **Pawsey Supercomputing Centre** and the conference [1]. For example:  \n- Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile is listed in metadata tags, but no transcript or summary of his ISC 2025 presentation is included [1].  \n- The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's LinkedIn page highlights general updates (e.g., event promotions like *ResBaz QLD* [2]), but no specific details about ISC 2025 discussions or his talk.  \n\nTo locate this information, you would need to:  \n1. Visit **Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile** directly to check for posts or articles about his ISC 2025 session.  \n2. Search the **Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's LinkedIn page** for ISC 2025-related updates or conference highlights.  \n\nIf the provided context lacks sufficient detail, consider consulting LinkedIn directly or reviewing official ISC 2025 materials for summaries of his presentation.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750049001,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching the web","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://au.linkedin.com/company/pawseysupercomputing","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/11/21/whats-the-status-of-quantum-hpc-integration-whats-it-good-for/","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2024-solution-forum-takeover","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumi-supercomputer","https://sg.linkedin.com/company/nsccsg","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jpgattuso_oosc-unoc-isc-activity-7246376640249761792-aMtU","https://uk.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-4d5485ea97f183e27a00abc11aa448333d0c75c971f54c27d55c","name":"Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre ISC 2025 Hamburg LinkedIn, Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation slides LinkedIn, Pawsey Supercomputing Centre ISC 2025 conference highlights LinkedIn","type":"web_search","urls":["https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://au.linkedin.com/company/pawseysupercomputing","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/11/21/whats-the-status-of-quantum-hpc-integration-whats-it-good-for/","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2024-solution-forum-takeover","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumi-supercomputer","https://sg.linkedin.com/company/nsccsg","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jpgattuso_oosc-unoc-isc-activity-7246376640249761792-aMtU","https://uk.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc"],"queries":["Mark Stickells Pawsey Supercomputing Centre ISC 2025 Hamburg LinkedIn","Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation slides LinkedIn","Pawsey Supercomputing Centre ISC 2025 conference highlights LinkedIn"]},"document":["#ISC25 -

The user wants me to visit Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile directly to check for posts or articles about his ISC 2025 session. But wait, in the previous interactions, the user provided some context sources, but those were just snippets from LinkedIn, probably metadata or tags mentioning Mark Stickells and the conference.\n> \n> First, I need to recall the guidelines. The user emphasized that I can only use the provided context. I can't actually browse the internet or access LinkedIn directly. So, even though the user is asking to visit the LinkedIn profile, I can't perform that action. My knowledge is limited to the context given.\n> \n> Looking back at the context sources, there were mentions of Mark Stickells' LinkedIn posts related to ISC 2025, but the actual content of those posts wasn't included. The sources only had his name, title, and hashtags like #ISC25, but no detailed information about his session. So, based on the context provided, there's no specific information about his presentation at ISC 2025 beyond his involvement and affiliation.\n> \n> The user might be expecting me to simulate visiting LinkedIn, but since I can't do that, I need to inform them that the available context doesn't have the necessary details. I should also mention that the existing sources only reference his participation and the conference themes but not the content of his talk.\n> \n> I should make sure to explain that I can't access external websites and that my answer is based solely on the provided context. It's important to be clear and helpful, maybe suggesting they check LinkedIn directly or look for official conference materials if the information isn't here.\n</details>\nI cannot directly access external websites, including LinkedIn, to retrieve real-time updates or verify current posts about Mark Stickells' ISC 2025 session. My analysis is limited to the provided context, which includes metadata references to his LinkedIn profile and the conference but lacks specific details about his presentation content [1]. \n\nFor direct verification, you would need to:  \n1. Visit Mark Stickells' LinkedIn profile manually to search for posts tagged with #ISC25 or related keywords.  \n2. Check the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's LinkedIn page for conference highlights or summaries mentioning his session.  \n\nIf no further context is available here, official ISC 2025 proceedings or recordings might also provide insights.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750049570,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching the web","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawseysupercomputing_ncris-adsn-teampawsey-activity-7271774740065738752-7gwn","https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-isc2025-hpc-activity-7339313057501728768-hd3H","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/pawsey-advances-genomic-research-with-amd-gpu-support-for-basecalling/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc/"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-ce7751510b2bce81dd41d36630934574ce3480ff8f33f71c2784","name":"Mark Stickells LinkedIn posts about International Supercomputing Conference 2025, Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation summary site:linkedin.com, Pawsey Supercomputing Centre LinkedIn ISC 2025 highlights featuring Mark Stickells","type":"web_search","urls":["https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","https://isc-hpc.com/program/","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawseysupercomputing_ncris-adsn-teampawsey-activity-7271774740065738752-7gwn","https://au.linkedin.com/in/markstickells","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-isc2025-hpc-activity-7339313057501728768-hd3H","https://www.linkedin.com/company/intersect360-research","https://womeninhpc.org/events/isc-2025-whpc-tech-talks","https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/pawsey-advances-genomic-research-with-amd-gpu-support-for-basecalling/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-hpc/"],"queries":["Mark Stickells LinkedIn posts about International Supercomputing Conference 2025","Mark Stickells ISC 2025 presentation summary site:linkedin.com","Pawsey Supercomputing Centre LinkedIn ISC 2025 highlights featuring Mark Stickells"]},"document":["#ISC25 -

We both offered our thanks to ISC and the organising teams behind WHPC for their efforts to support, engage and promote the community.\n \nMy closing points were to make a call for leaders to act in matters of diversity and inclusivity - not just for equity and ethical reasons but for competitive, business reasons, improving outcomes for all.\n\nI also looked ahead and invited colleagues to join us at SCAsia in Osaka next January - https://lnkd.in/gE9yhujw\n\nCristin Merritt Aditi Subramanya Jana Makar Emily Barker Linda McIver Karina Nunez\n#WHPCPlus #InclusionInTech #HPCAIcommunity #LeadershipMatters #Australasia #Supercomputing #DiversityInSTEM","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc25-connectingthedots-whpc-activity-7339311648765091840-b3kC","start_index":26,"title":"#ISC25 - #ConnectingtheDots - #WHPC | Mark Stickells AM"},{"description":"#ISC2025 - #ConnectingtheDots - #HPCaroundtheworldAPAC\n\nAs the APAC Chair of the ISC High Performance theme “HPC Around the World” I had the privilege of opening a focused discussion on the Asia-Pacific region — one of the most dynamic yet uneven contributors to global HPC-AI. Here were some of my introductory comments to set the scene for regional updates from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan:\n\n——-\nAccording to Intersect https://lnkd.in/gBEKckEN) - APAC accounts for 24% of the global HPC-AI market, but capacity is highly concentrated and asymmetric, with major shares in China (~45%), and Japan (~25%) with the rest of APAC accounting for ~7% of global capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, HPC is becoming a smaller slice of the AI infrastructure landscape, as hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centres, and cloud-optimised platforms reshape the field. \n\nKey challenges raised in a recent HPC-AI Leadership Organization (HALO) study included rising tech protectionism and geopolitical friction, access bottlenecks for GPUs, accelerators, and interconnects; diverging architectures between traditional HPC and AI workloads, growing demands for data sovereignty and a critical talent shortage across HPC, AI and quantum.\n\nThe questions posed to our APAC leaders at #ISC25 included: \n\nHow do we stay sovereign, collaborative and competitive? Where do we partner — across nations, sectors and disciplines? How do we better engage industry — not just as users, but as strategic partners?\n\nWith sincere thanks to our regional HPC leaders who shared their perspectives - with your leadership the future of HPC-AI will be regionally engaged, collaborative, and purpose-driven.\n\n- China - Professor Yutong Lu, Director of the National Supercomputing Center in Guangzhou \n- India - Dr Shri Magesh Director General and Dr S D Sudarsan are senior leaders at India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)\n- Japan - Professor Satoshi Matsuoka,  Director of RIKEN’s Center for Computational Science \n- South Korea - Dr Ji-Hoon Kang,  Director of the Supercomputing Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI)\n- Singapore - Dr Terence Hung, Chief Executive of the National Supercomputing Centre\n- Taiwan - Dr Weicheng Huang,  Director of the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC)\n\nThe ISC team have made recordings of the ISC Invited Program available as complementary content to the broader community. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g7rfnK2T\n\nAddison Snell Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre National Computational Infrastructure\n\n#HPC #AI #AsiaPacific #DigitalInfrastructure #HALO #ISC2025 #DataSovereignty #TechLeadership #QuantumComputing #Supercomputing #GlobalCollaboration","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markstickells_isc2025-connectingthedots-hpcaroundtheworldapac-activity-7339315857883353088-Ls0i","start_index":26,"title":"#ISC2025 - #ConnectingtheDots - #HPCaroundtheworldAPAC | Mark Stickells AM"},{"description":"🎉 Pawsey Wrap of the Week: Celebrating Achievements, Building Connections, and Looking Ahead 🌟\n\nHere’s what Team Pawsey has been up to:\n\n🔹 Showcasing Learn@Pawsey at STAWA Future Science Conference 🧪\nFathima Imra Haseen and Victor Olet delivered an inspiring session to 45 educators at the Science Teachers Association of WA Future Science Conference at The University of Western Australia.

Source 1 is from the website itself, with some markdown content. Sources 2, 3, and 4 provide additional information, though some might be duplicated since source 3 and 4 have the same id. Wait, source 3 and 4 have the same id but different content. That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but I need to handle them carefully.\n> \n> Starting with source 1, the main website content. The title is \"Home\" and it's from the 2022 annual report. There are images described, but the main text mentions support from the Australian Government with a $70 million grant under the Industry Research and Development Act. Also, support from the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) through the Department of Education.

Source 1 says $70 million under Industry Research and Development Act and NCRIS support. Source 2 says $90 million under NCRIS. Need to present both figures with their respective sources.\n> \n> The mission is about enabling science and accelerating discovery through dreaming big. The annual review covers 2022/23. Key achievements include the next-gen supercomputers with 30x compute power, power efficiency, and PaCER program details. Future initiatives involve the PSS and preparing researchers for exascale computing.\n> \n> Make sure to mention the support from various government bodies and partners. Also, include the PaCER projects' funding and objectives. Avoid mentioning images unless necessary, but the user asked for a detailed report, so maybe a brief note on the visual elements as part of the website's presentation.\n> \n> Need to structure the report with clear sections, using citations where applicable.

It also mentions the Pawsey Capital Refresh project, 30 times more compute power, and the PaCER program. Source 4 (same id as source 3) elaborates on PaCER, the $1.42 million partnership, exascale readiness, and optimizing codes.\n> \n> So putting this together, the report should include the funding details, mission, key projects, and future initiatives. Need to structure the report logically: introduction, funding, mission and vision, key achievements, future initiatives, and conclusion.\n> \n> Check for citations: source 1 has id=1, source 2 id=2, sources 3 and 4 both id=3. So when mentioning funding from the Australian Government, cite [1] and [2] where applicable. The next-gen supercomputers and PaCER program should cite [3].\n> \n> Also, note the discrepancies in funding amounts. Source 1 says $70 million under Industry Research and Development Act and NCRIS support. Source 2 says $90 million under NCRIS. Need to present both figures with their respective sources.\n> \n> The mission is about enabling science and accelerating discovery through dreaming big. The annual review covers 2022/23. Key achievements include the next-gen supercomputers with 30x compute power, power efficiency, and PaCER program details. Future initiatives involve the PSS and preparing researchers for exascale computing.\n> \n> Make sure to mention the support from various government bodies and partners. Also, include the PaCER projects' funding and objectives. Avoid mentioning images unless necessary, but the user asked for a detailed report, so maybe a brief note on the visual elements as part of the website's presentation.\n> \n> Need to structure the report with clear sections, using citations where applicable. Also, clarify if there are any inconsistencies in the data, like the funding amounts, but since the sources are separate, present both as per their sources.\n</details>\n**Detailed Report: Pawsey Supercomputing Centre 2022 Annual Report Website**  \n*URL: https://reports.pawsey.org.au/2022/home*  \n\n---\n\n### **1.

That probably means the web scraping tool couldn't retrieve the actual content from the site. The other sources (id=2) seem to have some snippets of information. \n> \n> The second source mentions $90 million in funding from the Australian Government under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. That's a key point about funding. Then there's a list of sections like \"New Technologies,\" \"Technology Refresh,\" \"Quantum Technologies,\" and various science showcases, case studies, project allocations, publications, and events. Also, there's a section on annual reports, including the 2022 report, and other documents like the annual overview from 2021-2022 and earlier reports.\n> \n> However, since the web scrape failed, the detailed content from the site isn't available. The context does provide some elements like funding details and structure of the report, but not the full content. So I need to inform the user that the scrape didn't work, but provide the available info from the sources. Also, check if there's any other data in the sources. \n> \n> The third and fourth sources with id=2 list more sections like \"Annual Report 2019-2020,\" \"Pawsey Supercomputing Annual Report 2018-19,\" and others, indicating that the site has a collection of past reports.

Key details include:  \n- **Voluntary participation** by 1,000 scientists contributing to AI research through prompts, problem descriptions, and responses [1].  \n- The session includes **720 problems**, **2,500 prompts**, and assessments of responses to advance AI capabilities [1].  \n- It emphasizes structured collaboration, with contributions organized into categories like model responses, attachments, and evaluations [1].  \n\nThe goal appears to focus on accelerating AI development through collective expertise and iterative testing.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750000547,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

Let me start by understanding what the original program entails. From previous interactions, the JAM Session involves scientists collaborating with AI models to solve complex problems, creating a shared corpus for future AI development.\n> \n> Now, looking at the context provided earlier, Australia's AI research initiatives include the CSIRO AI-ENGAGE program, National Science Priorities, and international collaborations. The context also mentions concerns about declining research investment and the need for strategic funding. So, any adapted program in Australia should align with these national priorities and address existing challenges like funding and collaboration.\n> \n> The user's query is about proposing a similar program across Australian institutions. I need to structure the response with key components that mirror the original but are tailored to Australia's context. Possible elements include partnerships with local institutions like CSIRO, universities, and industry players. Also, leveraging existing frameworks like the Australian Universities Accord could be important for funding.\n> \n> I should check the sources provided. Source 3 and 5 mention the need for increased investment in R&D to boost productivity and economic growth, which can be cited when discussing funding strategies. Source 4 talks about CSIRO's AI-ENGAGE team and global collaborations, suggesting that involving them would be essential. Source 5 also emphasizes the importance of implementation plans and investment in science priorities, which should be part of the proposed program's governance.\n> \n> Potential challenges might be ensuring participation across institutions and securing funding. The response should address these by proposing partnerships with government bodies like the Australian Research Council and industry stakeholders. Including metrics for success, like the number of problems solved or AI models developed, would align with the original JAM Session's outcomes.\n> \n> I need to ensure that citations are only used where the source has an id. For example, when mentioning increased R&D investment, cite source 3 and 5. When talking about CSIRO's role, cite source 4. Also, make sure not to use XML tags and keep the response in the same language as the user's query, which is English here.\n> \n> Finally, structure the response into clear sections like Objectives, Structure, Partnerships, Funding, and Outcomes, using bullet points for readability. Highlight how the program addresses Australia's specific needs, such as boosting productivity and aligning with national science priorities.\n</details>\nYes, adapting the **1000 Scientists AI JAM Session** model for Australia would align with national priorities to boost AI research, productivity, and collaboration.

\n   - **Economic Impact**: Track commercialization of AI solutions (e.g., spin-offs, patents) and productivity gains in priority sectors.  \n\n4. **International Collaboration**:  \n   - Integrate with global initiatives like **QUAD AI-Engage** and Japan’s RITE to align with international AI standards and attract foreign investment [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **Alignment with National Priorities**  \n- **National Science Priorities (2025)**: Focus on AI applications for climate, health, and critical minerals [5].  \n- **EDIH (European Digital Innovation Hubs)**: Adapt European frameworks for AI safety and hybrid workflows (e.g., AI + simulation) to Australian contexts [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **Challenges & Mitigation**  \n- **Funding Gaps**: Advocate for sustained investment via the **Future Made in Australia** policy [5].  \n- **Participation Barriers**: Offer grants to institutions to offset costs of AI infrastructure (e.g., GPU clusters like Isambard-AI) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Potential Impact**  \n- **Economic Growth**: Directly address productivity declines by deploying AI in sectors like agriculture and mining [3].  \n- **Global Competitiveness**: Position Australia as a leader in ethical AI research through partnerships like CSIRO’s AI-ENGAGE network [4].  \n\nThis program would require strong government-industry alignment but could mirror the success of the U.S. AI JAM Session while addressing Australia’s unique research and economic

Let me start by recalling the original proposal. The key components were participation from universities, CSIRO, and industry partners, with challenges in specific domains. Now, I need to integrate Pawsey into this framework.\n> \n> First, I should look at the context provided about Pawsey. The sources mention that Pawsey accelerates scientific discoveries and has expertise in computational science, supporting fields like radio astronomy, energy, resources, and bioinformatics. They are part of NCRIS, funded by the Australian government, and have a capital refresh project. They also collaborate with various stakeholders, including academia, government, and industry.\n> \n> So, how can Pawsey be incorporated? Let's see the original components:\n> \n> 1. **Collaborative Structure**: Participation from universities, CSIRO, industry. Now, add Pawsey here. Maybe they can provide computational infrastructure or expertise. They can host the AI JAM Corpus or offer their supercomputing resources for testing AI models.\n> \n> 2. **Governance & Funding**: Pawsey is already funded by the government, so maybe their existing infrastructure can be leveraged without additional funding. They might contribute by providing access to their supercomputing facilities, which would be a resource for participants.\n> \n> 3. **Outcomes & Metrics**: Pawsey's role in creating an AI Corpus could be emphasized, especially since they have experience in managing large data sets from their work in radio astronomy and other fields. They might also help in benchmarking AI models using their high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\n> \n> 4. **International Collaboration**: Pawsey's partnerships with international researchers could be a point here. They might facilitate global collaboration by connecting Australian researchers with international counterparts through their existing networks.\n> \n> Also, the user mentioned using Pawsey instead of or in addition to industry partners. So, in cases where industry partners might not be available or suitable, Pawsey can step in with their expertise and infrastructure. For example, in areas like climate resilience or critical minerals, Pawsey's computational resources can support AI-driven research that industry partners might not have the capacity for.\n> \n> I should also check the sources again to ensure accuracy. Source 3 and 4 mention Pawsey's role in supporting research in various fields and their partnerships. Source 4 also talks about collaborations with government, industry, and research institutions, which aligns with the need for cross-sector partnerships in the initiative.\n> \n> Potential sections to update:\n> \n> - In the Collaborative Structure, mention Pawsey providing computational infrastructure and expertise. They can co-host events or provide technical support.\n> - In Governance & Funding, note that Pawsey's existing infrastructure reduces the need for new investments.\n> - In Outcomes, highlight Pawsey's role in managing the AI Corpus and benchmarking AI models using their HPC systems.\n> - In Challenges & Mitigation, suggest that Pawsey can lower accessibility barriers by offering their supercomputing resources, similar to the Isambard-AI phase mentioned in source 2.\n> \n> I need to ensure that citations are correctly added where applicable. Since the sources have IDs, any mention of Pawsey's role should reference the appropriate source. For example, when talking about Pawsey's infrastructure, source 3 or 4 would be cited.\n> \n> Also, the user wants the adaptation to include Pawsey as a resource instead or in addition to industry partners. So, in some areas, Pawsey can replace industry partners, like providing computational resources, while in others, they can collaborate alongside them. For instance, industry partners might contribute domain-specific challenges, while Pawsey offers the technical infrastructure to solve them.\n> \n> Another point from the context: Pawsey is part of an unincorporated joint venture between several Australian institutions and CSIRO, which aligns with the collaborative structure of the initiative. This could be mentioned to emphasize their role in fostering collaboration.\n> \n> I should also consider how Pawsey's expertise in computational science can be leveraged to lower barriers for researchers. For example, their involvement might provide training or support in using HPC systems for AI, which is mentioned in source 2 regarding lowering accessibility barriers.\n> \n> Finally, ensure that the adapted response flows well, integrating Pawsey naturally into each component without disrupting the original structure. Make sure the benefits of involving Pawsey are clear, such as enhanced computational capabilities, existing partnerships, and alignment with national research priorities.\n</details>\nHere’s the **adapted \"Australia 1000 AI Collaborators Initiative\"** to explicitly incorporate the **Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre** as a critical resource, either in place of or alongside industry

Key aspects include:  \n\n1. **Objective**:  \n   - To evaluate how AI models can accelerate scientific discovery and improve capabilities in national security and basic science [4].  \n   - Develop benchmark challenge problems for AI research using realistic, representative tasks [3].  \n\n2. **Structure**:  \n   - Scientists voluntarily contribute **2–3 problems** from their domains, resulting in a diverse set of challenges [1].  \n   - Participants work in small teams to test AI models (e.g., OpenAI’s latest tools), record prompts, responses, and assessments to build the **AI JAM Corpus** [1].  \n   - The corpus is shared across DOE labs and industry partners (e.g., XAI, Nvidia, Google) to inform future AI development [1].  \n\n3. **Outcomes**:  \n   - The session provides early

Let me start by understanding what the original program entails. From previous interactions, the JAM Session involves scientists collaborating with AI models to solve complex problems, creating a shared corpus for future AI development.\n> \n> Now, looking at the context provided earlier, Australia's AI research initiatives include the CSIRO AI-ENGAGE program, National Science Priorities, and international collaborations. The context also mentions concerns about declining research investment and the need for strategic funding. So, any adapted program in Australia should align with these national priorities and address existing challenges like funding and collaboration.\n> \n> The user's query is about proposing a similar program across Australian institutions. I need to structure the response with key components that mirror the original but are tailored to Australia's context. Possible elements include partnerships with local institutions like CSIRO, universities, and industry players. Also, leveraging existing frameworks like the Australian Universities Accord could be important for funding.\n> \n> I should check the sources provided. Source 3 and 5 mention the need for increased investment in R&D to boost productivity and economic growth, which can be cited when discussing funding strategies. Source 4 talks about CSIRO's AI-ENGAGE team and global collaborations, suggesting that involving them would be essential. Source 5 also emphasizes the importance of implementation plans and investment in science priorities, which should be part of the proposed program's governance.\n> \n> Potential challenges might be ensuring participation across institutions and securing funding. The response should address these by proposing partnerships with government bodies like the Australian Research Council and industry stakeholders. Including metrics for success, like the number of problems solved or AI models developed, would align with the original JAM Session's outcomes.\n> \n> I need to ensure that citations are only used where the source has an id. For example, when mentioning increased R&D investment, cite source 3 and 5. When talking about CSIRO's role, cite source 4. Also, make sure not to use XML tags and keep the response in the same language as the user's query, which is English here.\n> \n> Finally, structure the response into clear sections like Objectives, Structure, Partnerships, Funding, and Outcomes, using bullet points for readability. Highlight how the program addresses Australia's specific needs, such as boosting productivity and aligning with national science priorities.\n</details>\nYes, adapting the **1000 Scientists AI JAM Session** model for Australia would align with national priorities to boost AI research, productivity, and collaboration. Below is a proposed framework tailored to Australia’s context, leveraging existing initiatives like **CSIRO AI-ENGAGE**, **National Science Priorities**, and university-industry partnerships:  \n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Program: \"Australia 1000 AI Collaborators Initiative\"**  \n**Objective**:  \n- Accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery and innovation across Australian institutions.  \n- Develop benchmarks for AI applications in priority areas (e.g., climate resilience, health, critical minerals, and quantum computing) [3][5].  \n- Strengthen Australia’s AI research ecosystem by bridging academia, industry, and government [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Components**  \n1. **Collaborative Structure**:  \n   - **Participation**: Recruit 1,000+ researchers from Australian universities (e.g., ANU, UNSW), CSIRO, and industry partners (e.g., Atlassian, mining companies).  \n   - **Challenges**: Scientists submit 2–3 domain-specific problems (e.g., optimizing renewable energy grids, AI for biodiversity monitoring).  \n   - **AI Tools**: Partner with global AI companies (e.g., Google DeepMind, Anthropic) and local startups to test models on these challenges.  \n\n2. **Governance & Funding**:  \n   - **Funding**: Leverage the **Australian Universities Accord** to secure government and private sector investment, aiming to increase R&D spending by 1% to unlock $24B in economic growth over 10 years [3][5].  \n   - **Coordination**: Partner with **CSIRO AI-ENGAGE** and the **Australian Research Council (ARC)** to manage problem submissions, AI model testing, and data sharing [4].  \n\n3. **Outcomes & Metrics**:  \n   - **AI Corpus**: Create an open-access repository of problems, prompts, and AI responses to train future models tailored to Australia’s needs.  \n   - **Economic Impact**: Track commercialization of AI solutions (e.g., spin-offs, patents) and productivity gains in priority sectors.  \n\n4. **International Collaboration**:  \n   - Integrate with global initiatives like **QUAD AI-Engage** and Japan’s RITE to align with international AI standards and attract foreign investment [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **Alignment with National Priorities**  \n- **National Science Priorities (2025)**: Focus on AI applications for climate, health, and critical minerals [5].  \n- **EDIH (European Digital Innovation Hubs)**: Adapt European frameworks for AI safety and hybrid workflows (e.g., AI + simulation) to Australian contexts [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **Challenges & Mitigation**  \n- **Funding Gaps**: Advocate for sustained investment via the **Future Made in Australia** policy [5].  \n- **Participation Barriers**: Offer grants to institutions to offset costs of AI infrastructure (e.g., GPU clusters like Isambard-AI) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Potential Impact**  \n- **Economic Growth**: Directly address productivity declines by deploying AI in sectors like agriculture and mining [3].  \n- **Global Competitiveness**: Position Australia as a leader in ethical AI research through partnerships like CSIRO’s AI-ENGAGE network [4].  \n\nThis program would require strong government-industry alignment but could mirror the success of the U.S. AI JAM Session while addressing Australia’s unique research and economic challenges.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1750001306,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

Let me start by recalling the original proposal. The key components were participation from universities, CSIRO, and industry partners, with challenges in specific domains. Now, I need to integrate Pawsey into this framework.\n> \n> First, I should look at the context provided about Pawsey. The sources mention that Pawsey accelerates scientific discoveries and has expertise in computational science, supporting fields like radio astronomy, energy, resources, and bioinformatics. They are part of NCRIS, funded by the Australian government, and have a capital refresh project. They also collaborate with various stakeholders, including academia, government, and industry.\n> \n> So, how can Pawsey be incorporated? Let's see the original components:\n> \n> 1. **Collaborative Structure**: Participation from universities, CSIRO, industry. Now, add Pawsey here. Maybe they can provide computational infrastructure or expertise. They can host the AI JAM Corpus or offer their supercomputing resources for testing AI models.\n> \n> 2. **Governance & Funding**: Pawsey is already funded by the government, so maybe their existing infrastructure can be leveraged without additional funding. They might contribute by providing access to their supercomputing facilities, which would be a resource for participants.\n> \n> 3. **Outcomes & Metrics**: Pawsey's role in creating an AI Corpus could be emphasized, especially since they have experience in managing large data sets from their work in radio astronomy and other fields. They might also help in benchmarking AI models using their high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\n> \n> 4. **International Collaboration**: Pawsey's partnerships with international researchers could be a point here. They might facilitate global collaboration by connecting Australian researchers with international counterparts through their existing networks.\n> \n> Also, the user mentioned using Pawsey instead of or in addition to industry partners. So, in cases where industry partners might not be available or suitable, Pawsey can step in with their expertise and infrastructure. For example, in areas like climate resilience or critical minerals, Pawsey's computational resources can support AI-driven research that industry partners might not have the capacity for.\n> \n> I should also check the sources again to ensure accuracy. Source 3 and 4 mention Pawsey's role in supporting research in various fields and their partnerships. Source 4 also talks about collaborations with government, industry, and research institutions, which aligns with the need for cross-sector partnerships in the initiative.\n> \n> Potential sections to update:\n> \n> - In the Collaborative Structure, mention Pawsey providing computational infrastructure and expertise. They can co-host events or provide technical support.\n> - In Governance & Funding, note that Pawsey's existing infrastructure reduces the need for new investments.\n> - In Outcomes, highlight Pawsey's role in managing the AI Corpus and benchmarking AI models using their HPC systems.\n> - In Challenges & Mitigation, suggest that Pawsey can lower accessibility barriers by offering their supercomputing resources, similar to the Isambard-AI phase mentioned in source 2.\n> \n> I need to ensure that citations are correctly added where applicable. Since the sources have IDs, any mention of Pawsey's role should reference the appropriate source. For example, when talking about Pawsey's infrastructure, source 3 or 4 would be cited.\n> \n> Also, the user wants the adaptation to include Pawsey as a resource instead or in addition to industry partners. So, in some areas, Pawsey can replace industry partners, like providing computational resources, while in others, they can collaborate alongside them. For instance, industry partners might contribute domain-specific challenges, while Pawsey offers the technical infrastructure to solve them.\n> \n> Another point from the context: Pawsey is part of an unincorporated joint venture between several Australian institutions and CSIRO, which aligns with the collaborative structure of the initiative. This could be mentioned to emphasize their role in fostering collaboration.\n> \n> I should also consider how Pawsey's expertise in computational science can be leveraged to lower barriers for researchers. For example, their involvement might provide training or support in using HPC systems for AI, which is mentioned in source 2 regarding lowering accessibility barriers.\n> \n> Finally, ensure that the adapted response flows well, integrating Pawsey naturally into each component without disrupting the original structure. Make sure the benefits of involving Pawsey are clear, such as enhanced computational capabilities, existing partnerships, and alignment with national research priorities.\n</details>\nHere’s the **adapted \"Australia 1000 AI Collaborators Initiative\"** to explicitly incorporate the **Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre** as a critical resource, either in place of or alongside industry

and fosters innovation across Australia’s research landscape. Named after Dr Joseph Pawsey, a pioneering Australian radio astronomer, we honour his legacy by enabling breakthroughs for over 4,000 researchers.  \nOur impact spans diverse fields such as radio astronomy, energy, resources, engineering, bioinformatics, and health sciences. As an unincorporated joint venture between CSIRO (Australia’s national science agency), Curtin University, Murdoch University, and The University of Western Australia, collaboration is our driving force.\nPawsey is an NCRIS facility funded by the Department of Education. The Australian Government also provided a $70 million grant for the Pawsey Capital Refresh project. Additionally, support for the Centre comes through the Western Australian Government and our partner organisations.\nLearn more about the ARDC’s partnerships.","Array; landmark ACDP facility and RV Investigator; \r\nNational Pawsey and the Atlas of Living Australia; and \r\na great deal of institutional research infrastructure, \r\nsome of which we intend to grow into national research \r\ninfrastructure such as the National Bushfire Research \r\nFacility.

type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"179\">\n<summary>Thought for 179 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user is from the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Australia. They support 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want to integrate AI and Generative AI to speed up scientific discovery. I need to draft a strategy using the provided context and other resources.\n> \n> First, let me look through the provided sources. Source 1 mentions Cineca's AI Strategy with HPC systems and moving towards a Data and AI Factory. That's relevant for integrating AI into existing HPC infrastructure. Source 2 talks about AI/LLM models as research assistants from the US DoE's 1000 scientists challenge. Also mentions training materials from Pawsey's AI training in June 2025, which is directly related. The link provided might have examples of AI simulations on single nodes, which could be useful for Pawsey's setup.\n> \n> Source 3 outlines an AI Research Resource design with modular data centers and lowering accessibility barriers. Modular DCs could help with scalability and sustainability. Source 4 discusses the US NAIRR proposal, existing HPC initiatives with Aurora and Frontier supercomputers, and public-private partnerships. The US approach includes funding mechanisms like grants and subsidies, which could inform Pawsey's funding strategies.\n> \n> Source 5 highlights AI in molecular science and engineering, making simulations more efficient. Mentions machine-learned potentials for quantum-chemical accuracy at lower costs. This is applicable to Pawsey's bioinformatics and physics workloads. Source 6 emphasizes building open AI innovation systems, focusing on basic theory and interdisciplinary collaboration. This could guide Pawsey's partnerships and talent development.\n> \n> National strategies: Australia's AI initiatives might align with the US and EU approaches. The EU's AI-oriented supercomputers mentioned in source 1 suggest international collaboration opportunities. Public-private partnerships from source 4 and 6 could be a model for Pawsey to access cloud resources and expertise.\n> \n> Key areas to address: Infrastructure, software stack, accessibility, collaboration, funding, training. Infrastructure should integrate AI-specific hardware (like GPUs) into existing HPC systems, inspired by Isambard AI phases from source 3. Modular data centers for scalability. Software needs co-designed stacks with public cloud compatibility (source 3) and open-source tools to encourage sharing (source 6).\n> \n> Lowering accessibility barriers: User-friendly interfaces, pre-configured environments, training programs like those at Pawsey (source 2). Collaboration with national labs and universities (source 4) and interdisciplinary teams (source 6) can drive innovation. Funding mechanisms from US examples could include grants and partnerships with industry.\n> \n> Training is crucial. Source 2 mentions their own AI training in 2025, so expanding that with workshops and resources from the link provided (AI simulations on laptops) could help users adopt AI techniques. Also, leveraging programs like the 1000 scientists challenge from US DoE (source 2) might offer frameworks for accelerating workflows.\n> \n> For scientific workflows, applying AI in simulations as per source 5—using machine-learned potentials for efficiency—could be a focus area. Bioinformatics might benefit from AI-driven data analysis pipelines. Physics simulations could use AI for faster modeling.\n> \n> Need to structure the strategy into sections: Infrastructure Development, Software and Tools, Accessibility and Training, Collaboration and Partnerships, Funding, Sustainability. Each section should reference the sources where applicable. For example, modular data centers [3], public-private partnerships [4], open innovation systems [6], and training programs [2].\n> \n> Also, ensure inline citations where sources have IDs. Since some sources don't have IDs but are relevant, need to mention them without citations. For example, source 5's mention of molecular science applications should be included but not cited because it's part of the framework context without an ID in the text. Wait, looking back, source 5 has an ID (5) but in the context, the user provided it as part of the framework. Wait, in the context, source 5's content includes a citation [13], but the source itself has an ID. So when referring to source 5's content, use [5].\n> \n> Check if all sources are properly cited. Source 1,2,3,4,5,6 all have IDs. So any info from them should be cited accordingly.\n> \n> Potential structure:\n> \n> 1. Infrastructure: Modular Data Centers [3], AI-specific hardware, integration with HPC (Cineca's Data and AI Factory [1]).\n> \n> 2. Software Stack: Co-design with public cloud users [3], open-source frameworks [6], machine-learned potentials [5].\n> \n> 3. Accessibility: User-friendly platforms, training programs [2], pre-configured environments.\n> \n> 4. Collaboration: Partnerships with national labs [4], interdisciplinary teams [6].\n> \n> 5. Funding: Grants, public-private partnerships [4].\n> \n> 6. Training: Workshops, leveraging existing materials [2], AI as research assistants [2].\n> \n> 7. Sustainability: Modular DCs for energy efficiency [3], align with national strategies [6].\n> \n> Need to ensure each point references the appropriate source IDs. Also, mention international examples like US's Aurora/Frontier [4] and EU's supercomputers [1] as benchmarks.\n> \n> Possible challenges: Ensuring compatibility between AI and traditional HPC workloads, user adoption, funding sustainability. Address these by phased implementation, pilot programs, and continuous feedback loops.\n> \n> Finally, tie everything back to accelerating scientific discovery for their 4000 users in physics and bioinformatics.\n</details>\nBased on the context provided and global best practices, here's a draft strategy for Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre to integrate AI/Generative AI into scientific workflows:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Infrastructure Development: Modular & AI-Optimized HPC Systems**\n- **Leverage Modular Data Centers (MDCs):** Adopt scalable MDCs to integrate AI-specific hardware (e.g., GPUs/TPUs) alongside traditional HPC systems, ensuring flexibility for future AI advancements [3].  \n- **Hybrid Architecture:** Follow the EU model of combining HPC with AI systems (e.g., Cineca’s \"Data and AI Factory\" vision) to support both simulation-driven and AI-driven workflows [1].  \n- **Benchmarking:** Study U.S. systems like Aurora and Frontier (DOE’s AI-focused supercomputers) for performance optimization in AI-accelerated simulations [4].\n\n---\n\n### **2. Software & Tools: Co-Designed AI Stacks**\n- **Open-Source AI Frameworks:** Develop co-designed software stacks with public cloud compatibility (e.g., Isambard AI’s phase 2 approach) to lower barriers for researchers [3].  \n- **Domain-Specific AI Models:** Implement pre-trained models for bioinformatics (e.g., AlphaFold integration) and physics simulations, inspired by machine-learned potentials that reduce computational costs while maintaining quantum-chemical accuracy [5].  \n- **AI Simulation Libraries:** Provide access to lightweight AI simulation tools (e.g., via Setonix-tested environments) for rapid prototyping on laptops/nodes before scaling to supercomputers [2].\n\n---\n\n### **3. Accessibility & Training: Democratizing AI Adoption**\n- **User-Friendly Platforms:** Create intuitive interfaces (e.g., JupyterHub integrations) for non-AI experts to access AI workflows, aligning with the \"lowering accessibility barriers\" principle [3].  \n- **Training Programs:** Expand AI literacy through workshops (building on Pawsey’s 2025 AI training [2]) and partner with initiatives like the DOE’s 1,000 Scientists Challenge to train researchers in AI-driven discovery [2].  \n- **Guided Pipelines:** Develop templates for common tasks (e.g., protein structure prediction, cosmological modeling) to streamline AI adoption.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Collaboration & National Alignment**\n- **National AI Research Resource (NAIRR):** Advocate for Australia to establish a NAIRR-like framework, pooling compute, datasets, and expertise (mirroring U.S. proposals) [4].  \n- **Public-Private Partnerships:** Collaborate with industry (e.g., NVIDIA, AWS) for cutting-edge AI tools and co-funding, as seen in U.S. and EU models [4].  \n- **Interdisciplinary Hubs:** Foster collaboration between Pawsey, universities, and national labs (e.g., ANSTO, CSIRO) to co-develop AI applications for cross-domain challenges [6].\n\n---\n\n### **5. Funding & Sustainability**\n- **Diverse Funding Mechanisms:** Combine government grants, industry subsidies, and academic partnerships to fund AI infrastructure and R&D [4].  \n- **Energy Efficiency:** Prioritize MDCs with liquid cooling and renewable energy integration to offset AI’s high energy demands [3].  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Pilot Programs & Iterative Deployment**\n- **Phase 1:** Launch pilot projects in high-impact areas (e.g., genomics, materials science) using existing AI/LLM models as research assistants [2].  \n- **Phase 2:** Scale successful pilots to full workflows, incorporating feedback from scientists.  \n- **Phase 3:** Expand to generative AI for *de novo* discovery (e.g., designing new materials or proteins).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Outcomes for Pawsey Users**\n- **Accelerated Workflows:** Reduce simulation times via AI-predicted material properties or optimized bioinformatics pipelines [5].  \n- **Democratized Access:** Ensure 4,000+ researchers can leverage AI without deep learning expertise.  \n- **Global Competitiveness:** Align with national AI strategies (Australia, U.S., EU) to position Pawsey as a leader in AI-driven science [1][4][6].  \n\nBy adopting this strategy, Pawsey can bridge the gap between traditional HPC and AI, transforming scientific discovery while aligning with global trends.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749797442,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

Let me start by recalling the context provided earlier. The previous response mentioned workforce training programs and skills gaps, citing sources like McKinsey's report and examples from other supercomputing centers.\n> \n> First, I need to extract the relevant parts from the context. The sources mention skill gaps in AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and integration specialists. There's also talk about upskilling existing employees through tailored training, like bootcamps and prompt engineering classes. Specific examples include the OSC Senior Client Engineer Summer Wang who became more comfortable after a bootcamp, and the need for staff to stay updated on AI software.\n> \n> The user's Pawsey Center supports 4000 scientists, so their staff must handle both traditional HPC and new AI tools. The answer should cover technical skills (like AI/ML frameworks, HPC systems), domain-specific knowledge (physics, bioinformatics), and soft skills (collaboration, communication). Also, training programs are crucial, as mentioned in sources 3 and 4. \n> \n> I should structure the answer into sections: Core Technical Skills, Domain-Specific Expertise, Collaboration & Communication, Training Programs, and Continuous Learning. Each section needs to reference the context where applicable. For example, when talking about training, citing the OSC bootcamp example with source id 4. When discussing skill gaps, citing the McKinsey report with source id 3. \n> \n> Need to ensure that citations are only used where the source has an explicit id. Check the context again: sources 3 and 4 have the required skills and training info. The OSC example in source 4 is about their bootcamp program, so that's a good citation for training initiatives. The McKinsey report in source 3 discusses skill gaps and upskilling strategies, so that's relevant for the skills section.\n> \n> Also, mention the importance of staying updated with AI trends and tools, as the cyberinfrastructure staff must keep pace with evolving technologies. This ties into continuous learning and providing access to cutting-edge tools, as per the McKinsey report.\n> \n> Make sure not to include any XML tags and keep the citations in [id] format. Avoid making the answer too technical without context; explain each point clearly, linking it back to the user's needs at Pawsey. Highlight how these skills enable staff to co-design workflows and provide expert advice, which is essential for integrating AI into scientific research effectively.\n</details>\nTo effectively operate AI-integrated infrastructure and co-design workflows with scientists, staff at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre will require a blend of **technical expertise, domain knowledge, and collaborative skills**, as highlighted in global strategies and workforce training models:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Technical Skills**  \n- **AI/ML Proficiency:** Staff must master frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch and understand HPC-AI integration (e.g., GPU optimization, distributed training). This aligns with the EU’s emphasis on \"AI Factories\" and \"supercomputer-friendly programming facilities\" [2].  \n- **HPC Systems Management:** Expertise in managing hybrid HPC-AI systems (e.g., NVIDIA DGX systems, Slurm/PBS scheduling) is critical, as seen in the U.S. DOE’s AI-ready supercomputers [4].  \n- **Code Translation & Optimization:** Skills in translating legacy HPC code to AI-enhanced workflows (e.g., using LLMs for code generation) and optimizing performance on AI accelerators [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Domain-Specific Expertise**  \n- **Scientific Literacy:** Staff must understand the domains they support (e.g., physics simulations, bioinformatics) to co-design workflows. For example, knowledge of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS) or genomics pipelines (e.g., STAR aligner) enables tailored AI integration [5].  \n- **AI for Frontier Science:** Familiarity with \"FrontierMath\"-style challenges (e.g., solving complex PDEs or protein folding with AI) ensures staff can address cutting-edge problems [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Collaboration & Communication**  \n- **Co-Design Methodology:** Staff must work iteratively with scientists to refine AI models, as emphasized in the EU’s \"One Stop-Shop\" approach for data spaces and AI ecosystems [2].  \n- **User Advocacy:** Strong communication skills to translate scientists’ needs into technical solutions, mirroring the OSC bootcamp model where engineers engaged directly with AI tools to better support users [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Training & Upskilling Programs**  \n- **Bootcamps & Certifications:** Implement structured training (e.g., NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute certifications) and role-specific workshops, such as:  \n  - **Technical Teams:** Advanced GPU programming, AI/ML library creation.  \n  - **Functional Teams:** Prompt engineering for scientific reasoning (e.g., using LLMs for hypothesis generation) [3].  \n- **Hands-On Pilots:** Partner with programs like the DOE’s 1,000 Scientists Challenge to provide staff with real-world AI co-design experience [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Continuous Learning & Adaptability**  \n- **Staying Current:** Staff must engage with open-source AI communities (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face) and attend conferences like the TPC25 Hackathon to adopt emerging tools [1].  \n- **Experimentation Culture:** Encourage staff to test new AI frameworks (e.g., JAX, Ray) in lab-style environments, as recommended by McKinsey for overcoming skill gaps [3].  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation at Pawsey**  \n- **Skill Gap Assessment:** Audit existing staff capabilities against these requirements, as 46% of global leaders cite skill gaps as a barrier to AI adoption [3].  \n- **Hybrid Roles:** Create roles like \"AI Research Engineers\" who bridge HPC and AI, inspired by the EU’s \"AI integration specialists\" [2].  \n- **Feedback Loops:** Use scientist

Notably, 46 percent of leaders identify skill gaps in their workforces as a significant barrier to AI adoption. Leaders will need to attract and hire top-level talent, including AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and AI integration specialists. They will also need to commit to creating an environment that is attractive to technologists. For example, this can mean providing them with plenty of time to experiment, offering access to cutting-edge tools, creating opportunities to engage in open-source communities, and promoting a collaborative engineering culture. Upskilling existing employees is just as critical: Research from McKinsey’s People and Organizational Performance Practice underscores the importance of tailoring training to specific roles, such as offering technical team members bootcamps on library creation while offering prompt engineering classes to specific functional teams.19People & Organization Blog, \"Upskilling and reskilling priorities for the","OSC Senior Client Engineer Summer Wang, pictured on the right in OSC’s data center with other staff, became more comfortable with supporting AI technologies after participating in the bootcamp.“We’ve had strong interest in the program from higher education institutions, government agencies and industry,” said Karen Tomko, OSC director of research software applications. “Our participants have been very engaged in the programming, asking a lot of questions and providing feedback that has shaped the curriculum over the course of the pilot project.”\nMore clients of HPC centers are using AI tools to pursue their research, and cyberinfrastructure staff must stay on top of fast-evolving AI software and technologies to meet these needs.","AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey"],"metadata":[{"description":"Almost all companies invest in AI, but just 1% believe they are at maturity.

type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"179\">\n<summary>Thought for 179 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user is from the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Australia. They support 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want to integrate AI and Generative AI to speed up scientific discovery. I need to draft a strategy using the provided context and other resources.\n> \n> First, let me look through the provided sources. Source 1 mentions Cineca's AI Strategy with HPC systems and moving towards a Data and AI Factory. That's relevant for integrating AI into existing HPC infrastructure. Source 2 talks about AI/LLM models as research assistants from the US DoE's 1000 scientists challenge. Also mentions training materials from Pawsey's AI training in June 2025, which is directly related. The link provided might have examples of AI simulations on single nodes, which could be useful for Pawsey's setup.\n> \n> Source 3 outlines an AI Research Resource design with modular data centers and lowering accessibility barriers. Modular DCs could help with scalability and sustainability. Source 4 discusses the US NAIRR proposal, existing HPC initiatives with Aurora and Frontier supercomputers, and public-private partnerships. The US approach includes funding mechanisms like grants and subsidies, which could inform Pawsey's funding strategies.\n> \n> Source 5 highlights AI in molecular science and engineering, making simulations more efficient. Mentions machine-learned potentials for quantum-chemical accuracy at lower costs. This is applicable to Pawsey's bioinformatics and physics workloads. Source 6 emphasizes building open AI innovation systems, focusing on basic theory and interdisciplinary collaboration. This could guide Pawsey's partnerships and talent development.\n> \n> National strategies: Australia's AI initiatives might align with the US and EU approaches. The EU's AI-oriented supercomputers mentioned in source 1 suggest international collaboration opportunities. Public-private partnerships from source 4 and 6 could be a model for Pawsey to access cloud resources and expertise.\n> \n> Key areas to address: Infrastructure, software stack, accessibility, collaboration, funding, training. Infrastructure should integrate AI-specific hardware (like GPUs) into existing HPC systems, inspired by Isambard AI phases from source 3. Modular data centers for scalability. Software needs co-designed stacks with public cloud compatibility (source 3) and open-source tools to encourage sharing (source 6).\n> \n> Lowering accessibility barriers: User-friendly interfaces, pre-configured environments, training programs like those at Pawsey (source 2). Collaboration with national labs and universities (source 4) and interdisciplinary teams (source 6) can drive innovation. Funding mechanisms from US examples could include grants and partnerships with industry.\n> \n> Training is crucial. Source 2 mentions their own AI training in 2025, so expanding that with workshops and resources from the link provided (AI simulations on laptops) could help users adopt AI techniques. Also, leveraging programs like the 1000 scientists challenge from US DoE (source 2) might offer frameworks for accelerating workflows.\n> \n> For scientific workflows, applying AI in simulations as per source 5—using machine-learned potentials for efficiency—could be a focus area. Bioinformatics might benefit from AI-driven data analysis pipelines. Physics simulations could use AI for faster modeling.\n> \n> Need to structure the strategy into sections: Infrastructure Development, Software and Tools, Accessibility and Training, Collaboration and Partnerships, Funding, Sustainability. Each section should reference the sources where applicable. For example, modular data centers [3], public-private partnerships [4], open innovation systems [6], and training programs [2].\n> \n> Also, ensure inline citations where sources have IDs. Since some sources don't have IDs but are relevant, need to mention them without citations. For example, source 5's mention of molecular science applications should be included but not cited because it's part of the framework context without an ID in the text. Wait, looking back, source 5 has an ID (5) but in the context, the user provided it as part of the framework. Wait, in the context, source 5's content includes a citation [13], but the source itself has an ID. So when referring to source 5's content, use [5].\n> \n> Check if all sources are properly cited. Source 1,2,3,4,5,6 all have IDs. So any info from them should be cited accordingly.\n> \n> Potential structure:\n> \n> 1. Infrastructure: Modular Data Centers [3], AI-specific hardware, integration with HPC (Cineca's Data and AI Factory [1]).\n> \n> 2. Software Stack: Co-design with public cloud users [3], open-source frameworks [6], machine-learned potentials [5].\n> \n> 3. Accessibility: User-friendly platforms, training programs [2], pre-configured environments.\n> \n> 4. Collaboration: Partnerships with national labs [4], interdisciplinary teams [6].\n> \n> 5. Funding: Grants, public-private partnerships [4].\n> \n> 6. Training: Workshops, leveraging existing materials [2], AI as research assistants [2].\n> \n> 7. Sustainability: Modular DCs for energy efficiency [3], align with national strategies [6].\n> \n> Need to ensure each point references the appropriate source IDs. Also, mention international examples like US's Aurora/Frontier [4] and EU's supercomputers [1] as benchmarks.\n> \n> Possible challenges: Ensuring compatibility between AI and traditional HPC workloads, user adoption, funding sustainability. Address these by phased implementation, pilot programs, and continuous feedback loops.\n> \n> Finally, tie everything back to accelerating scientific discovery for their 4000 users in physics and bioinformatics.\n</details>\nBased on the context provided and global best practices, here's a draft strategy for Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre to integrate AI/Generative AI into scientific workflows:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Infrastructure Development: Modular & AI-Optimized HPC Systems**\n- **Leverage Modular Data Centers (MDCs):** Adopt scalable MDCs to integrate AI-specific hardware (e.g., GPUs/TPUs) alongside traditional HPC systems, ensuring flexibility for future AI advancements [3].  \n- **Hybrid Architecture:** Follow the EU model of combining HPC with AI systems (e.g., Cineca’s \"Data and AI Factory\" vision) to support both simulation-driven and AI-driven workflows [1].  \n- **Benchmarking:** Study U.S. systems like Aurora and Frontier (DOE’s AI-focused supercomputers) for performance optimization in AI-accelerated simulations [4].\n\n---\n\n### **2. Software & Tools: Co-Designed AI Stacks**\n- **Open-Source AI Frameworks:** Develop co-designed software stacks with public cloud compatibility (e.g., Isambard AI’s phase 2 approach) to lower barriers for researchers [3].  \n- **Domain-Specific AI Models:** Implement pre-trained models for bioinformatics (e.g., AlphaFold integration) and physics simulations, inspired by machine-learned potentials that reduce computational costs while maintaining quantum-chemical accuracy [5].  \n- **AI Simulation Libraries:** Provide access to lightweight AI simulation tools (e.g., via Setonix-tested environments) for rapid prototyping on laptops/nodes before scaling to supercomputers [2].\n\n---\n\n### **3. Accessibility & Training: Democratizing AI Adoption**\n- **User-Friendly Platforms:** Create intuitive interfaces (e.g., JupyterHub integrations) for non-AI experts to access AI workflows, aligning with the \"lowering accessibility barriers\" principle [3].  \n- **Training Programs:** Expand AI literacy through workshops (building on Pawsey’s 2025 AI training [2]) and partner with initiatives like the DOE’s 1,000 Scientists Challenge to train researchers in AI-driven discovery [2].  \n- **Guided Pipelines:** Develop templates for common tasks (e.g., protein structure prediction, cosmological modeling) to streamline AI adoption.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Collaboration & National Alignment**\n- **National AI Research Resource (NAIRR):** Advocate for Australia to establish a NAIRR-like framework, pooling compute, datasets, and expertise (mirroring U.S. proposals) [4].  \n- **Public-Private Partnerships:** Collaborate with industry (e.g., NVIDIA, AWS) for cutting-edge AI tools and co-funding, as seen in U.S. and EU models [4].  \n- **Interdisciplinary Hubs:** Foster collaboration between Pawsey, universities, and national labs (e.g., ANSTO, CSIRO) to co-develop AI applications for cross-domain challenges [6].\n\n---\n\n### **5. Funding & Sustainability**\n- **Diverse Funding Mechanisms:** Combine government grants, industry subsidies, and academic partnerships to fund AI infrastructure and R&D [4].  \n- **Energy Efficiency:** Prioritize MDCs with liquid cooling and renewable energy integration to offset AI’s high energy demands [3].  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Pilot Programs & Iterative Deployment**\n- **Phase 1:** Launch pilot projects in high-impact areas (e.g., genomics, materials science) using existing AI/LLM models as research assistants [2].  \n- **Phase 2:** Scale successful pilots to full workflows, incorporating feedback from scientists.  \n- **Phase 3:** Expand to generative AI for *de novo* discovery (e.g., designing new materials or proteins).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Outcomes for Pawsey Users**\n- **Accelerated Workflows:** Reduce simulation times via AI-predicted material properties or optimized bioinformatics pipelines [5].  \n- **Democratized Access:** Ensure 4,000+ researchers can leverage AI without deep learning expertise.  \n- **Global Competitiveness:** Align with national AI strategies (Australia, U.S., EU) to position Pawsey as a leader in AI-driven science [1][4][6].  \n\nBy adopting this strategy, Pawsey can bridge the gap between traditional HPC and AI, transforming scientific discovery while aligning with global trends.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749797442,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

Let me start by recalling the context provided earlier. The previous response mentioned workforce training programs and skills gaps, citing sources like McKinsey's report and examples from other supercomputing centers.\n> \n> First, I need to extract the relevant parts from the context. The sources mention skill gaps in AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and integration specialists. There's also talk about upskilling existing employees through tailored training, like bootcamps and prompt engineering classes. Specific examples include the OSC Senior Client Engineer Summer Wang who became more comfortable after a bootcamp, and the need for staff to stay updated on AI software.\n> \n> The user's Pawsey Center supports 4000 scientists, so their staff must handle both traditional HPC and new AI tools. The answer should cover technical skills (like AI/ML frameworks, HPC systems), domain-specific knowledge (physics, bioinformatics), and soft skills (collaboration, communication). Also, training programs are crucial, as mentioned in sources 3 and 4. \n> \n> I should structure the answer into sections: Core Technical Skills, Domain-Specific Expertise, Collaboration & Communication, Training Programs, and Continuous Learning. Each section needs to reference the context where applicable. For example, when talking about training, citing the OSC bootcamp example with source id 4. When discussing skill gaps, citing the McKinsey report with source id 3. \n> \n> Need to ensure that citations are only used where the source has an explicit id. Check the context again: sources 3 and 4 have the required skills and training info. The OSC example in source 4 is about their bootcamp program, so that's a good citation for training initiatives. The McKinsey report in source 3 discusses skill gaps and upskilling strategies, so that's relevant for the skills section.\n> \n> Also, mention the importance of staying updated with AI trends and tools, as the cyberinfrastructure staff must keep pace with evolving technologies. This ties into continuous learning and providing access to cutting-edge tools, as per the McKinsey report.\n> \n> Make sure not to include any XML tags and keep the citations in [id] format. Avoid making the answer too technical without context; explain each point clearly, linking it back to the user's needs at Pawsey. Highlight how these skills enable staff to co-design workflows and provide expert advice, which is essential for integrating AI into scientific research effectively.\n</details>\nTo effectively operate AI-integrated infrastructure and co-design workflows with scientists, staff at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre will require a blend of **technical expertise, domain knowledge, and collaborative skills**, as highlighted in global strategies and workforce training models:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Technical Skills**  \n- **AI/ML Proficiency:** Staff must master frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch and understand HPC-AI integration (e.g., GPU optimization, distributed training). This aligns with the EU’s emphasis on \"AI Factories\" and \"supercomputer-friendly programming facilities\" [2].  \n- **HPC Systems Management:** Expertise in managing hybrid HPC-AI systems (e.g., NVIDIA DGX systems, Slurm/PBS scheduling) is critical, as seen in the U.S. DOE’s AI-ready supercomputers [4].  \n- **Code Translation & Optimization:** Skills in translating legacy HPC code to AI-enhanced workflows (e.g., using LLMs for code generation) and optimizing performance on AI accelerators [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Domain-Specific Expertise**  \n- **Scientific Literacy:** Staff must understand the domains they support (e.g., physics simulations, bioinformatics) to co-design workflows. For example, knowledge of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS) or genomics pipelines (e.g., STAR aligner) enables tailored AI integration [5].  \n- **AI for Frontier Science:** Familiarity with \"FrontierMath\"-style challenges (e.g., solving complex PDEs or protein folding with AI) ensures staff can address cutting-edge problems [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Collaboration & Communication**  \n- **Co-Design Methodology:** Staff must work iteratively with scientists to refine AI models, as emphasized in the EU’s \"One Stop-Shop\" approach for data spaces and AI ecosystems [2].  \n- **User Advocacy:** Strong communication skills to translate scientists’ needs into technical solutions, mirroring the OSC bootcamp model where engineers engaged directly with AI tools to better support users [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Training & Upskilling Programs**  \n- **Bootcamps & Certifications:** Implement structured training (e.g., NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute certifications) and role-specific workshops, such as:  \n  - **Technical Teams:** Advanced GPU programming, AI/ML library creation.  \n  - **Functional Teams:** Prompt engineering for scientific reasoning (e.g., using LLMs for hypothesis generation) [3].  \n- **Hands-On Pilots:** Partner with programs like the DOE’s 1,000 Scientists Challenge to provide staff with real-world AI co-design experience [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Continuous Learning & Adaptability**  \n- **Staying Current:** Staff must engage with open-source AI communities (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face) and attend conferences like the TPC25 Hackathon to adopt emerging tools [1].  \n- **Experimentation Culture:** Encourage staff to test new AI frameworks (e.g., JAX, Ray) in lab-style environments, as recommended by McKinsey for overcoming skill gaps [3].  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation at Pawsey**  \n- **Skill Gap Assessment:** Audit existing staff capabilities against these requirements, as 46% of global leaders cite skill gaps as a barrier to AI adoption [3].  \n- **Hybrid Roles:** Create roles like \"AI Research Engineers\" who bridge HPC and AI, inspired by the EU’s \"AI integration specialists\" [2].  \n- **Feedback Loops:** Use scientist feedback (e.g., via Pawsey’s training surveys) to refine staff competencies, similar to OSC’s iterative bootcamp curriculum [4].  \n\nBy aligning staff development with these priorities, Pawsey can ensure its team not only operates AI-enhanced infrastructure but also becomes a strategic partner in accelerating scientific discovery.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749797973,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

Let me start by checking the provided context to see if there's any existing information about this URL or the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's 2022 annual report.\n> \n> Looking at the context, there are three sources listed, all with the same ID \"1\" and name. They seem to mention the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre's 2022 annual report, including key findings, achievements, executive summary, highlights, and projects. However, the content provided in the context appears to be fragmented and possibly copied incorrectly.

The user works at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Australia and wants a strategy to implement AI and GenAI services for their 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want the strategy to use uploaded content, other supercomputing centers' info, and national AI strategies.\n> \n> First, I need to look at the provided context. The uploaded sources mention things like integrating AI with HPC, modular data centers, lowering accessibility barriers, and national strategies from various countries. There's also a focus on co-designing software stacks and sustainability through MDCs. The sources from Australia and others talk about AI sovereignty and managing dependencies rather than full control.\n> \n> The user mentioned using web resources, but since I can't access the web, I have to rely solely on the uploaded content. I should structure the strategy based on the themes in the sources. Let's break it down into sections like infrastructure, software, accessibility, collaboration, and alignment with national strategies.\n> \n> Infrastructure-wise, the sources talk about modular data centers and integrating AI with HPC. So suggesting a modular approach for scalability and energy efficiency makes sense, citing source 2. Also, leveraging existing HPC systems as mentioned in source 1.\n> \n> For the software stack, co-designing with public cloud users (source 2) and optimizing for GenAI workloads like bioinformatics. Maybe mention frameworks from national strategies, though the sources don't specify which ones, so perhaps avoid citations here.\n> \n> Lowering barriers to entry is another point from source 2. Training programs and user-friendly platforms would help scientists adopt AI. Source 3 mentions technical hurdles, so addressing those through support teams.\n> \n> Collaboration with national strategies: source 4 discusses Australia's approach to AI sovereignty, focusing on managing usage rather than full control. Aligning with Australia's national AI strategy, as mentioned in source 5, would be important. Also, international collaboration as per source 4's comparison of strategies.\n> \n> Ethics and data governance from the EU's strategy in source 4 should be included. Sustainability through MDCs from source 2 as well.\n> \n> Phase-wise implementation: Phase 1 could involve pilot projects and infrastructure upgrades, Phase 2 scaling up and training, Phase 3 sustainability and international partnerships. Sources 1 and 2 mention phases, so citing those.\n> \n> Need to check if all citations are correctly applied. Only sources with id attributes. Source 3,4,5 don't have ids in the context provided? Wait, looking back:\n> \n> Wait, in the context, the first three sources have id=\"1\" (two of them?), then source 2, then sources 3,4,5. Wait the XML shows:\n> \n> First source: id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\"\n> Second source: id=\"2\", name=\"AI Strategy\"\n> Third source: id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\" again? That might be a duplication error. Then sources 3,4,5 have id=3,4,5. So sources 1 (twice?), 2,3,4,5.\n> \n> Wait, looking at the user's provided context:\n> \n> The first <source> has id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\", then another <source> with id=\"2\", name=\"AI Strategy\". Then another <source> with id=\"1\", same name. Then sources 3,4,5 with ids 3,4,5. That seems like a possible duplication error, but as per the user's input, I have to use the sources as given.\n> \n> So when citing, need to check which source has the id. For example, when talking about modular data centers and phase 1/2, source 2 mentions MDC and phases. Source 3 talks about technical hurdles. Source 4 mentions national strategies like Australia's, and source 5 discusses sovereign AI and Australia's report.\n> \n> So in the strategy, when talking about national alignment, citing sources 4 and 5 where Australia's approach is discussed. When discussing technical hurdles, source 3. When discussing infrastructure and MDC, source 2.\n> \n> Also, need to ensure that citations are only used when the source has an id. The first and third sources have id=1, but their content seems similar. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow as per the given.\n> \n> Putting it all together, the strategy should have sections on infrastructure, software, accessibility, collaboration, national alignment, ethics, and phased implementation, citing relevant sources where applicable. Also, note that the sources don't cover everything, so where necessary, use own knowledge but mention that the context doesn't provide info and provide the answer based on general understanding. But in this case, the sources do cover enough points to build the strategy with citations.\n</details>\nBased on the provided context and alignment with national AI strategies, here’s a draft strategy for implementing AI services at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Infrastructure Modernization: Modular AI-HPC Integration**  \n- **Modular Data Centres (MDCs):** Adopt scalable MDCs to integrate AI accelerators (e.g., GPUs/TPUs) with existing HPC systems, ensuring energy efficiency and flexibility for evolving AI workloads [2].  \n- **Hybrid AI-HPC Systems:** Leverage the EU’s approach to AI-oriented supercomputers by designing systems that co-process simulation data and AI models (e.g., for physics simulations or bioinformatics) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Software Stack Co-Design for AI Workloads**  \n- **Domain-Specific Optimization:** Collaborate with researchers to co-design AI frameworks tailored to bioinformatics (e.g., genomics) and physics (e.g., particle simulations), prioritizing interoperability with existing HPC tools [2].  \n- **Generative AI Pipelines:** Develop pre-trained models for tasks like protein folding prediction or cosmological data synthesis, using techniques from the \"Data and AI Factory\" concept to automate workflows [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Lowering Accessibility Barriers**  \n- **Training Programs:** Offer workshops on AI/ML for scientists, focusing on integrating AI into traditional HPC workflows (e.g., using PyTorch/TensorFlow with MPI).  \n- **User-Friendly Platforms:** Deploy AI-as-a-Service portals with pre-configured environments, inspired by Isambard AI’s phase 1 results [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. National and International Collaboration**  \n- **Align with Australia’s AI Sovereignty Goals:** Partner with national initiatives (e.g., the Australia Foundation Models Report) to ensure sovereign control over AI model usage, even if full domestic development isn’t feasible [5].  \n- **Benchmark Against Global Strategies:** Adopt best practices from the EU (data governance/ethics) and China (basic research investment) to strengthen Australia’s AI infrastructure policy depth [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Ethical and Sustainable AI**  \n- **Ethical AI Frameworks:** Integrate governance protocols for AI-driven research, ensuring transparency in outputs (e.g., reproducibility of generative models in bioinformatics).  \n- **Sustainability Focus:** Prioritize energy-efficient AI hardware and workflows, aligning with Cineca’s \"Towards AI Factory\" vision [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Phases**  \n- **Phase 1 (0–12 Months):** Pilot AI-HPC integration for 2–3 priority domains (e.g., astrophysics, structural biology) and establish an AI ethics advisory board.  \n- **Phase 2 (12–24 Months):** Scale AI services to 4000+ users, develop domain-specific GenAI models, and optimize software stacks for public cloud interoperability [2].  \n- **Phase 3 (24+ Months):** Expand MDC infrastructure and deepen partnerships with international HPC centers (e.g., EU’s EuroHPC) to share AI research and tools [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Challenges to Address**  \n- **Technical Hurdles:** AI models require vast compute resources; optimize training methods to reduce dependency on raw processing power [3].  \n- **Sovereignty vs. Collaboration:** Balance Australia’s need for AI sovereignty with reliance on global frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, PyTorch) [5].  \n\nBy aligning with global best practices and leveraging modular, ethical AI integration, Pawsey can position itself as a leader in accelerating scientific discovery through AI.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749779143,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

thereby enabling automated data analysis, far more efficient production practices, and new predictive capabilities in fields such as biology, materials science, and cosmology. Integrating AI models with the world’s fastest computers offers powerful synergistic effects: allowing these systems to process huge datasets and run complex experimental workflows, improving the accuracy and applicability of AI systems, and enhancing the computational efficiency of supercomputers. This synergy will open broad new research avenues and greatly accelerate the pace of many existing projects. However, successfully integrating AI and supercomputing requires overcoming several technical hurdles.","Collectively we present the most detailed and comprehensive empirical analysis undertaken of national AI infrastructures to date. This analysis provides comparisons and contrasts across 54 national strategies and a granular look at what these strategies contain. We note the priorities that are contained in documents, but our analysis also points out the policy depth for particular countries. Policy depth refers to the extent to which countries have covered the entire gamut of issues that comprise an infrastructure, and the institutional and financial resources they have committed to these issues. For example, AI policies from leading powers such as United States and China contain depth for basic research capabilities in science and mathematics, while the European Union policies contain the most depth for data governance and ethics. For example, one of the strategic objectives stated in the Chinese AI strategy states: “by 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories","capacity, and developing training methods that rely on less computing power. These issues highlight that pursuing sovereign AI strategies is often more about managing dependencies than eliminating them. In reality, what most countries working toward AI sovereignty are doing is building a Jenga-like AI stack that gives them enough control and knowledge of AI technology to understand and react to changing technology, market, and geopolitical conditions but falls short of complete control akin to what India and others have over their satellite navigation systems. As the Australia Foundation Models Report observes about AI models: “Sovereign capability doesn’t necessarily mean the whole AI model is developed and managed from within Australia; it’s about our ability to manage how the model is used.”As the Australian analysis suggests, most governments that pursue sovereign AI won’t have full control of the technology (for context, neither do the United States and China—the world’s AI"],"metadata":[{"embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-US","source":"https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/exascale-machine-learning-technologies/","start_index":1278,"title":"Exascale Machine Learning Technologies - Exascale Computing Project"},{"description":"This report provides evidence to illustrate how cultural values and institutional priorities shape artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructures in national and global contexts.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-US","source":"https://www.stimson.org/2023/2023-global-artificial-intelligence-infrastructures-report/","start_index":13989,"title":"2023 Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructures Report • Stimson Center"},{"description":"As countries develop sovereign AI, U.S. policymakers must understand and navigate the trend to maintain leadership and foster collaboration.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/sovereign-ai-in-a-hybrid-world--national-strategies-and-policy-responses","start_index":31584,"title":"\r\n\tSovereign AI in a Hybrid World: National Strategies and Policy Responses | Lawfare\r\n"}],"distances":[0.8637273609638214,0.8378602862358093,0.8368981182575226]}],"lastSentence":"Sovereignty vs. Collaboration: Balance Australia’s need for AI sovereignty with reliance on global frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, PyTorch) [5].","done":true},"91d7d8ca-e912-493a-b700-edb9fdc170d8":{"id":"91d7d8ca-e912-493a-b700-edb9fdc170d8","parentId":"c4f52870-4eb4-479c-8bc5-ab5e3cf7b155","childrenIds":["2c5d1b71-5cf4-45f9-ad0d-3a98d101b3a5"],"role":"user","content":"From the previous prompt and response and using content from the uploaded documents and the web, create the content for a presentation of 10 slides with 3 bullet point items per slide also providing the prompts for generating images related to the content of each slide.","timestamp":1749780401,"models":["Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B"]},"2c5d1b71-5cf4-45f9-ad0d-3a98d101b3a5":{"parentId":"91d7d8ca-e912-493a-b700-edb9fdc170d8","id":"2c5d1b71-5cf4-45f9-ad0d-3a98d101b3a5","childrenIds":[],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"285\">\n<summary>Thought for 285 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, so the user wants a presentation with 10 slides, each having 3 bullet points and image prompts. They mentioned using the uploaded documents and web content. Let me start by recalling the previous strategy I drafted for Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. The strategy had five main sections: Infrastructure Modernization, Software Stack Co-Design, Lowering Accessibility Barriers, Collaboration, Ethical AI, and Implementation Phases. But since they need 10 slides, I need to break this down further.\n> \n> First, the title slide. That's straightforward. Then, maybe a slide on the current landscape. The user works at Pawsey, supporting 4000 scientists in physics and bioinformatics. So the second slide could outline their current focus areas. Then, moving into the strategy sections. Each main section from the strategy can be split into two slides. For example, Infrastructure Modernization could be split into Modular Data Centers and Hybrid AI-HPC Systems. Similarly for Software Stack Co-Design, maybe one slide on domain-specific optimization and another on Generative AI Pipelines. \n> \n> Lowering Accessibility Barriers had two points: training and user-friendly platforms. Maybe split into two slides or combine with another section. Wait, the user mentioned 10 slides, so each main point might need expansion. Let me check the original strategy again. The strategy had 5 main points with subpoints. To get to 10 slides, each main point can have two slides, or some can have more. Alternatively, some slides can cover phases or challenges.\n> \n> The implementation phases were three phases. Each phase could be a slide, but that might take three slides. Challenges were two points. Maybe combine them into one slide. Also, the user wants 3 bullet points per slide. So each slide should have three concise points. \n> \n> Let me outline possible slides:\n> \n> 1. Title Slide\n> 2. Current Landscape & Research Focus\n> 3. Strategic Pillar 1: Infrastructure Modernization\n> 4. Strategic Pillar 2: Software Stack Co-Design\n> 5. Strategic Pillar 3: Accessibility & Training\n> 6. Strategic Pillar 4: National/Global Collaboration\n> 7. Strategic Pillar 5: Ethical & Sustainable AI\n> 8. Implementation Phases\n> 9. Challenges & Mitigation Strategies\n> 10. Conclusion & Vision\n> \n> That's 10 slides. Each strategic pillar can have 3 bullet points. For example, Infrastructure Modernization can include Modular Data Centers, Hybrid Systems, and Experimental Platforms. Wait, in the original strategy, Infrastructure Modernization had two bullet points. Maybe I need to expand each into three points or add another. Let me check the documents. The context mentioned AI Factories, One Stop Shops, Data Spaces, etc. Also, the EuroHPC JU's procurement of supercomputers. So for Infrastructure, maybe include Modular Data Centers, Hybrid AI-HPC Systems, and Experimental Platforms (like the one in Germany's Julich AI Factory from source 3). \n> \n> Similarly, Software Stack Co-Design can have domain-specific optimization, Generative AI Pipelines, and maybe integration with existing HPC tools. \n> \n> For Accessibility, Training Programs, User-Friendly Platforms, and perhaps Partnerships for Education. \n> \n> Collaboration could include aligning with Australia's AI strategies, EU's EuroHPC, and international partnerships. \n> \n> Ethical AI would cover governance, sustainability, and data privacy. \n> \n> Implementation phases can be broken into three slides, each phase having three points. But the user wants 3 bullet points per slide, so maybe each phase is a slide with three points. However, the original strategy had three phases. So maybe one slide per phase. But that would only make three slides. Wait, the user wants 10 slides. Let me adjust.\n> \n> Alternatively, spread each phase into multiple points. But perhaps better to structure each strategic pillar into two slides. Let me try again:\n> \n> 1. Title Slide\n> 2. Current Landscape & Research Focus\n> 3. Strategic Pillar 1: Infrastructure Modernization (Modular MDCs, Hybrid AI-HPC, Experimental Platforms)\n> 4. Strategic Pillar 2: Software Stack Co-Design (Domain-Specific Optimization, Generative AI Pipelines, Interoperability)\n> 5. Strategic Pillar 3: Accessibility & Training (Workshops, AI-as-a-Service, Community Engagement)\n> 6. Strategic Pillar 4: National Collaboration (Australia's AI Sovereignty, Partnerships, Sovereign Models)\n> 7. Strategic Pillar 5: Global Collaboration (EU's EuroHPC, International Benchmarks, Shared Research)\n> 8. Strategic Pillar 6: Ethical AI (Governance, Transparency, Data Privacy)\n> 9. Strategic Pillar 7: Sustainable AI (Energy Efficiency, Resource Optimization, Future-Proofing)\n> 10. Implementation Phases & Vision\n> \n> Hmm, that's 10 slides. Each slide has three bullet points. For image prompts, each slide should have a visual that represents the content. For example, Infrastructure Modernization could have a data center with modular units. Hybrid AI-HPC might show a system combining traditional HPC with AI accelerators. \n> \n> I need to ensure that the bullet points are concise and each image prompt is descriptive enough for generating relevant images. Also, citations from the sources where applicable. The sources had IDs 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, Modular Data Centers can cite source 1 which mentions AI Factories and Data Spaces. Hybrid AI-HPC systems are mentioned in source 3 and 4. The EuroHPC collaboration is in source 3. \n> \n> I should check each bullet point to see if there's a source with an ID to cite. If not, no citation is needed. For instance, the mention of Australia's AI Sovereignty might not have a source in the provided context, so no citation. \n> \n> Also, the user mentioned using web resources, but since I can't access the web, I have to rely on the provided context. So only citations from the given sources. \n> \n> Putting it all together, each slide's bullet points should include relevant citations where the source has an ID. For example, in Infrastructure Modernization, mentioning AI Factories from source 3 would cite [3]. \n> \n> I need to make sure that each bullet point that references a source includes the correct ID. Let me go through each slide's bullet points and add citations where applicable.\n</details>\nHere’s a 10-slide presentation draft with 3 bullet points per slide and image prompts, incorporating

The procurement process for the AI Factories is managed by EuroHPC JU. By 2026, these AI Factories will be the backbone of Europe’s AI strategy, combining computing power, data, and talent to drive innovation and secure Europe’s leadership in AI.  Background  The EuroHPC JU is a legal and funding entity, created in 2018 and reviewed in 2021 by Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1173 to enable the European Union and participating countries to coordinate efforts and pool resources with the objective of making Europe a world leader in supercomputing.   In order to equip Europe with a world-leading supercomputing infrastructure, the EuroHPC JU has already procured nine supercomputers, located across Europe. Regardless of their location in Europe, European scientists and users from the public sector and industry can benefit from these EuroHPC supercomputers via the EuroHPC Access Calls. This access enables them to advance science and support the development","the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.Graphical abstractDownload: Download high-res image (237KB)Download: Download full-size","France and Germany will establish AI Factories, which operate alongside Europe’s first exascale supercomputers, Alice Recoque and JUPITER.

The user works at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Australia and wants a strategy to implement AI and GenAI services for their 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want the strategy to use uploaded content, other supercomputing centers' info, and national AI strategies.\n> \n> First, I need to look at the provided context. The uploaded sources mention things like integrating AI with HPC, modular data centers, lowering accessibility barriers, and national strategies from various countries. There's also a focus on co-designing software stacks and sustainability through MDCs. The sources from Australia and others talk about AI sovereignty and managing dependencies rather than full control.\n> \n> The user mentioned using web resources, but since I can't access the web, I have to rely solely on the uploaded content. I should structure the strategy based on the themes in the sources. Let's break it down into sections like infrastructure, software, accessibility, collaboration, and alignment with national strategies.\n> \n> Infrastructure-wise, the sources talk about modular data centers and integrating AI with HPC. So suggesting a modular approach for scalability and energy efficiency makes sense, citing source 2. Also, leveraging existing HPC systems as mentioned in source 1.\n> \n> For the software stack, co-designing with public cloud users (source 2) and optimizing for GenAI workloads like bioinformatics. Maybe mention frameworks from national strategies, though the sources don't specify which ones, so perhaps avoid citations here.\n> \n> Lowering barriers to entry is another point from source 2. Training programs and user-friendly platforms would help scientists adopt AI. Source 3 mentions technical hurdles, so addressing those through support teams.\n> \n> Collaboration with national strategies: source 4 discusses Australia's approach to AI sovereignty, focusing on managing usage rather than full control. Aligning with Australia's national AI strategy, as mentioned in source 5, would be important. Also, international collaboration as per source 4's comparison of strategies.\n> \n> Ethics and data governance from the EU's strategy in source 4 should be included. Sustainability through MDCs from source 2 as well.\n> \n> Phase-wise implementation: Phase 1 could involve pilot projects and infrastructure upgrades, Phase 2 scaling up and training, Phase 3 sustainability and international partnerships. Sources 1 and 2 mention phases, so citing those.\n> \n> Need to check if all citations are correctly applied. Only sources with id attributes. Source 3,4,5 don't have ids in the context provided? Wait, looking back:\n> \n> Wait, in the context, the first three sources have id=\"1\" (two of them?), then source 2, then sources 3,4,5. Wait the XML shows:\n> \n> First source: id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\"\n> Second source: id=\"2\", name=\"AI Strategy\"\n> Third source: id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\" again? That might be a duplication error. Then sources 3,4,5 have id=3,4,5. So sources 1 (twice?), 2,3,4,5.\n> \n> Wait, looking at the user's provided context:\n> \n> The first <source> has id=\"1\", name=\"AI Strategy\", then another <source> with id=\"2\", name=\"AI Strategy\". Then another <source> with id=\"1\", same name. Then sources 3,4,5 with ids 3,4,5. That seems like a possible duplication error, but as per the user's input, I have to use the sources as given.\n> \n> So when citing, need to check which source has the id. For example, when talking about modular data centers and phase 1/2, source 2 mentions MDC and phases. Source 3 talks about technical hurdles. Source 4 mentions national strategies like Australia's, and source 5 discusses sovereign AI and Australia's report.\n> \n> So in the strategy, when talking about national alignment, citing sources 4 and 5 where Australia's approach is discussed. When discussing technical hurdles, source 3. When discussing infrastructure and MDC, source 2.\n> \n> Also, need to ensure that citations are only used when the source has an id. The first and third sources have id=1, but their content seems similar. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow as per the given.\n> \n> Putting it all together, the strategy should have sections on infrastructure, software, accessibility, collaboration, national alignment, ethics, and phased implementation, citing relevant sources where applicable. Also, note that the sources don't cover everything, so where necessary, use own knowledge but mention that the context doesn't provide info and provide the answer based on general understanding. But in this case, the sources do cover enough points to build the strategy with citations.\n</details>\nBased on the provided context and alignment with national AI strategies, here’s a draft strategy for implementing AI services at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Infrastructure Modernization: Modular AI-HPC Integration**  \n- **Modular Data Centres (MDCs):** Adopt scalable MDCs to integrate AI accelerators (e.g., GPUs/TPUs) with existing HPC systems, ensuring energy efficiency and flexibility for evolving AI workloads [2].  \n- **Hybrid AI-HPC Systems:** Leverage the EU’s approach to AI-oriented supercomputers by designing systems that co-process simulation data and AI models (e.g., for physics simulations or bioinformatics) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Software Stack Co-Design for AI Workloads**  \n- **Domain-Specific Optimization:** Collaborate with researchers to co-design AI frameworks tailored to bioinformatics (e.g., genomics) and physics (e.g., particle simulations), prioritizing interoperability with existing HPC tools [2].  \n- **Generative AI Pipelines:** Develop pre-trained models for tasks like protein folding prediction or cosmological data synthesis, using techniques from the \"Data and AI Factory\" concept to automate workflows [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Lowering Accessibility Barriers**  \n- **Training Programs:** Offer workshops on AI/ML for scientists, focusing on integrating AI into traditional HPC workflows (e.g., using PyTorch/TensorFlow with MPI).  \n- **User-Friendly Platforms:** Deploy AI-as-a-Service portals with pre-configured environments, inspired by Isambard AI’s phase 1 results [2].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. National and International Collaboration**  \n- **Align with Australia’s AI Sovereignty Goals:** Partner with national initiatives (e.g., the Australia Foundation Models Report) to ensure sovereign control over AI model usage, even if full domestic development isn’t feasible [5].  \n- **Benchmark Against Global Strategies:** Adopt best practices from the EU (data governance/ethics) and China (basic research investment) to strengthen Australia’s AI infrastructure policy depth [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Ethical and Sustainable AI**  \n- **Ethical AI Frameworks:** Integrate governance protocols for AI-driven research, ensuring transparency in outputs (e.g., reproducibility of generative models in bioinformatics).  \n- **Sustainability Focus:** Prioritize energy-efficient AI hardware and workflows, aligning with Cineca’s \"Towards AI Factory\" vision [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Phases**  \n- **Phase 1 (0–12 Months):** Pilot AI-HPC integration for 2–3 priority domains (e.g., astrophysics, structural biology) and establish an AI ethics advisory board.  \n- **Phase 2 (12–24 Months):** Scale AI services to 4000+ users, develop domain-specific GenAI models, and optimize software stacks for public cloud interoperability [2].  \n- **Phase 3 (24+ Months):** Expand MDC infrastructure and deepen partnerships with international HPC centers (e.g., EU’s EuroHPC) to share AI research and tools [4].  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Challenges to Address**  \n- **Technical Hurdles:** AI models require vast compute resources; optimize training methods to reduce dependency on raw processing power [3].  \n- **Sovereignty vs. Collaboration:** Balance Australia’s need for AI sovereignty with reliance on global frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, PyTorch) [5].  \n\nBy aligning with global best practices and leveraging modular, ethical AI integration, Pawsey can position itself as a leader in accelerating scientific discovery through AI.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749779143,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search

thereby enabling automated data analysis, far more efficient production practices, and new predictive capabilities in fields such as biology, materials science, and cosmology. Integrating AI models with the world’s fastest computers offers powerful synergistic effects: allowing these systems to process huge datasets and run complex experimental workflows, improving the accuracy and applicability of AI systems, and enhancing the computational efficiency of supercomputers. This synergy will open broad new research avenues and greatly accelerate the pace of many existing projects. However, successfully integrating AI and supercomputing requires overcoming several technical hurdles.","Collectively we present the most detailed and comprehensive empirical analysis undertaken of national AI infrastructures to date. This analysis provides comparisons and contrasts across 54 national strategies and a granular look at what these strategies contain. We note the priorities that are contained in documents, but our analysis also points out the policy depth for particular countries. Policy depth refers to the extent to which countries have covered the entire gamut of issues that comprise an infrastructure, and the institutional and financial resources they have committed to these issues. For example, AI policies from leading powers such as United States and China contain depth for basic research capabilities in science and mathematics, while the European Union policies contain the most depth for data governance and ethics. For example, one of the strategic objectives stated in the Chinese AI strategy states: “by 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories","capacity, and developing training methods that rely on less computing power. These issues highlight that pursuing sovereign AI strategies is often more about managing dependencies than eliminating them. In reality, what most countries working toward AI sovereignty are doing is building a Jenga-like AI stack that gives them enough control and knowledge of AI technology to understand and react to changing technology, market, and geopolitical conditions but falls short of complete control akin to what India and others have over their satellite navigation systems. As the Australia Foundation Models Report observes about AI models: “Sovereign capability doesn’t necessarily mean the whole AI model is developed and managed from within Australia; it’s about our ability to manage how the model is used.”As the Australian analysis suggests, most governments that pursue sovereign AI won’t have full control of the technology (for context, neither do the United States and China—the world’s AI"],"metadata":[{"embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-US","source":"https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/exascale-machine-learning-technologies/","start_index":1278,"title":"Exascale Machine Learning Technologies - Exascale Computing Project"},{"description":"This report provides evidence to illustrate how cultural values and institutional priorities shape artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructures in national and global contexts.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-US","source":"https://www.stimson.org/2023/2023-global-artificial-intelligence-infrastructures-report/","start_index":13989,"title":"2023 Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructures Report • Stimson Center"},{"description":"As countries develop sovereign AI, U.S. policymakers must understand and navigate the trend to maintain leadership and foster collaboration.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/sovereign-ai-in-a-hybrid-world--national-strategies-and-policy-responses","start_index":31584,"title":"\r\n\tSovereign AI in a Hybrid World: National Strategies and Policy Responses | Lawfare\r\n"}],"distances":[0.8637273609638214,0.8378602862358093,0.8368981182575226]}],"lastSentence":"Sovereignty vs. Collaboration: Balance Australia’s need for AI sovereignty with reliance on global frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, PyTorch) [5].","done":true},{"id":"91d7d8ca-e912-493a-b700-edb9fdc170d8","parentId":"c4f52870-4eb4-479c-8bc5-ab5e3cf7b155","childrenIds":["2c5d1b71-5cf4-45f9-ad0d-3a98d101b3a5"],"role":"user","content":"From the previous prompt and response and using content from the uploaded documents and the web, create the content for a presentation of 10 slides with 3 bullet point items per slide also providing the prompts for generating images related to the content of each slide.","timestamp":1749780401,"models":["Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B"]},{"parentId":"91d7d8ca-e912-493a-b700-edb9fdc170d8","id":"2c5d1b71-5cf4-45f9-ad0d-3a98d101b3a5","childrenIds":[],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"285\">\n<summary>Thought for 285 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, so the user wants a presentation with 10 slides, each having 3 bullet points and image prompts. They mentioned using the uploaded documents and web content. Let me start by recalling the previous strategy I drafted for Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. The strategy had five main sections: Infrastructure Modernization, Software Stack Co-Design, Lowering Accessibility Barriers, Collaboration, Ethical AI, and Implementation Phases. But since they need 10 slides, I need to break this down further.\n> \n> First, the title slide. That's straightforward. Then, maybe a slide on the current landscape. The user works at Pawsey, supporting 4000 scientists in physics and bioinformatics. So the second slide could outline their current focus areas. Then, moving into the strategy sections. Each main section from the strategy can be split into two slides. For example, Infrastructure Modernization could be split into Modular Data Centers and Hybrid AI-HPC Systems. Similarly for Software Stack Co-Design, maybe one slide on domain-specific optimization and another on Generative AI Pipelines. \n> \n> Lowering Accessibility Barriers had two points: training and user-friendly platforms. Maybe split into two slides or combine with another section. Wait, the user mentioned 10 slides, so each main point might need expansion. Let me check the original strategy again. The strategy had 5 main points with subpoints. To get to 10 slides, each main point can have two slides, or some can have more. Alternatively, some slides can cover phases or challenges.\n> \n> The implementation phases were three phases. Each phase could be a slide, but that might take three slides. Challenges were two points. Maybe combine them into one slide. Also, the user wants 3 bullet points per slide. So each slide should have three concise points. \n> \n> Let me outline possible slides:\n> \n> 1. Title Slide\n> 2. Current Landscape & Research Focus\n> 3. Strategic Pillar 1: Infrastructure Modernization\n> 4. Strategic Pillar 2: Software Stack Co-Design\n> 5. Strategic Pillar 3: Accessibility & Training\n> 6. Strategic Pillar 4: National/Global Collaboration\n> 7. Strategic Pillar 5: Ethical & Sustainable AI\n> 8. Implementation Phases\n> 9. Challenges & Mitigation Strategies\n> 10. Conclusion & Vision\n> \n> That's 10 slides. Each strategic pillar can have 3 bullet points. For example, Infrastructure Modernization can include Modular Data Centers, Hybrid Systems, and Experimental Platforms. Wait, in the original strategy, Infrastructure Modernization had two bullet points. Maybe I need to expand each into three points or add another. Let me check the documents. The context mentioned AI Factories, One Stop Shops, Data Spaces, etc. Also, the EuroHPC JU's procurement of supercomputers. So for Infrastructure, maybe include Modular Data Centers, Hybrid AI-HPC Systems, and Experimental Platforms (like the one in Germany's Julich AI Factory from source 3). \n> \n> Similarly, Software Stack Co-Design can have domain-specific optimization, Generative AI Pipelines, and maybe integration with existing HPC tools. \n> \n> For Accessibility, Training Programs, User-Friendly Platforms, and perhaps Partnerships for Education. \n> \n> Collaboration could include aligning with Australia's AI strategies, EU's EuroHPC, and international partnerships. \n> \n> Ethical AI would cover governance, sustainability, and data privacy. \n> \n> Implementation phases can be broken into three slides, each phase having three points. But the user wants 3 bullet points per slide, so maybe each phase is a slide with three points. However, the original strategy had three phases. So maybe one slide per phase. But that would only make three slides. Wait, the user wants 10 slides. Let me adjust.\n> \n> Alternatively, spread each phase into multiple points. But perhaps better to structure each strategic pillar into two slides. Let me try again:\n> \n> 1. Title Slide\n> 2. Current Landscape & Research Focus\n> 3. Strategic Pillar 1: Infrastructure Modernization (Modular MDCs, Hybrid AI-HPC, Experimental Platforms)\n> 4. Strategic Pillar 2: Software Stack Co-Design (Domain-Specific Optimization, Generative AI Pipelines, Interoperability)\n> 5. Strategic Pillar 3: Accessibility & Training (Workshops, AI-as-a-Service, Community Engagement)\n> 6. Strategic Pillar 4: National Collaboration (Australia's AI Sovereignty, Partnerships, Sovereign Models)\n> 7. Strategic Pillar 5: Global Collaboration (EU's EuroHPC, International Benchmarks, Shared Research)\n> 8. Strategic Pillar 6: Ethical AI (Governance, Transparency, Data Privacy)\n> 9. Strategic Pillar 7: Sustainable AI (Energy Efficiency, Resource Optimization, Future-Proofing)\n> 10. Implementation Phases & Vision\n> \n> Hmm, that's 10 slides. Each slide has three bullet points. For image prompts, each slide should have a visual that represents the content. For example, Infrastructure Modernization could have a data center with modular units. Hybrid AI-HPC might show a system combining traditional HPC with AI accelerators. \n> \n> I need to ensure that the bullet points are concise and each image prompt is descriptive enough for generating relevant images. Also, citations from the sources where applicable. The sources had IDs 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, Modular Data Centers can cite source 1 which mentions AI Factories and Data Spaces. Hybrid AI-HPC systems are mentioned in source 3 and 4. The EuroHPC collaboration is in source 3. \n> \n> I should check each bullet point to see if there's a source with an ID to cite. If not, no citation is needed. For instance, the mention of Australia's AI Sovereignty might not have a source in the provided context, so no citation. \n> \n> Also, the user mentioned using web resources, but since I can't access the web, I have to rely on the provided context. So only citations from the given sources. \n> \n> Putting it all together, each slide's bullet points should include relevant citations where the source has an ID. For example, in Infrastructure Modernization, mentioning AI Factories from source 3 would cite [3]. \n> \n> I need to make sure that each bullet point that references a source includes the correct ID. Let me go through each slide's bullet points and add citations where applicable.\n</details>\nHere’s a 10-slide presentation draft with 3 bullet points per slide and image prompts, incorporating

The procurement process for the AI Factories is managed by EuroHPC JU. By 2026, these AI Factories will be the backbone of Europe’s AI strategy, combining computing power, data, and talent to drive innovation and secure Europe’s leadership in AI.  Background  The EuroHPC JU is a legal and funding entity, created in 2018 and reviewed in 2021 by Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1173 to enable the European Union and participating countries to coordinate efforts and pool resources with the objective of making Europe a world leader in supercomputing.   In order to equip Europe with a world-leading supercomputing infrastructure, the EuroHPC JU has already procured nine supercomputers, located across Europe. Regardless of their location in Europe, European scientists and users from the public sector and industry can benefit from these EuroHPC supercomputers via the EuroHPC Access Calls. This access enables them to advance science and support the development","the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.Graphical abstractDownload: Download high-res image (237KB)Download: Download full-size","France and Germany will establish AI Factories, which operate alongside Europe’s first exascale supercomputers, Alice Recoque and JUPITER. Meanwhile, Austria, Bulgaria, Poland and Slovenia, will deploy new AI-optimised systems with AI Factories to further expand Europe’s AI infrastructure. The AI Factory in Germany (Julich) will also include an experimental platform, which will serve as a cutting-edge infrastructure for developing and testing innovative AI models and applications, as well as promoting collaboration across Europe. These new six AI Factories will be added to the seven AI Factories previously selected, creating an interconnected network of AI hubs ready to accommodate AI innovation across Europe.  Each factory will be one-stop shop, offering AI startups, SMEs, and researchers with comprehensive support to develop their data-sets as well as to access to AI-optimised high-performance computing (HPC) resources, training, and technical expertise."],"metadata":[{"description":"The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) has selected six new sites across Europe to host additional AI Factories, which

Supercomputing Research Centre. They support 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want to accelerate scientific discovery.\n> \n> First, I need to look at the provided context. The sources mention Cineca's AI Strategy, focusing on AI Factories, Data Spaces, HPC systems, and EU's AI-oriented supercomputers. There's talk about One Stop-Shops, Talent & Competences, and Access & AI-HPC services. The sources are from Sanzio Bassini in March 2025 and November 2023, part of Cineca's SuperComputing Applications & Innovations. \n> \n> I should incorporate elements from Cineca's strategy, like creating an AI Factory and Data Spaces. Also, considering national AI strategies from the EU and Australia. The user mentioned other supercomputing centers, so maybe reference initiatives like the EU's AI Factories or the US's AI research resource programs.\n> \n> The strategy should have components like infrastructure, data management, talent development, collaboration, and ethical considerations. Each section can draw from the provided sources where applicable. For example, the AI Factory concept from Cineca [1], Data Spaces [1], and Talent & Competences [1]. Also, integrating national strategies like Australia's AI Ethics Framework and the EU's AI Act for compliance.\n> \n> Need to ensure that citations are only used when the source has an id. All provided sources have id=\"1\", so each mention of Cineca's strategy should cite [1]. Also, check if other elements like HPC integration with AI are covered in the sources. The context mentions HPC systems in the EU and AI-HPC services, so that's another cite [1].\n> \n> Make sure the strategy is actionable: building AI-dedicated infrastructure, creating data platforms, training programs, partnerships with industry and academia, and ensuring ethical AI use. Each point should link to the sources where possible. If some parts are based on my own knowledge (like US initiatives or Australian policies), explain that and don't cite unless the source has an id.\n> \n> Finally, structure the response with clear sections, use citations appropriately, and ensure it's tailored to Pawsey's specific context of supporting 4000 scientists in physics and bioinformatics.\n</details>\nBased on the provided context and global best practices, here's a strategy tailored to Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre's goals, incorporating insights from Cineca's AI Strategy [1] and international AI/HPC trends:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Establish an AI Factory Framework**  \nAdopt Cineca’s \"Data and AI Factory\" vision [1], integrating AI with HPC workflows to accelerate discovery:  \n- **AI-HPC Convergence**: Develop hybrid workflows combining physics-based simulations with AI/ML models (e.g., surrogate models for faster parameter optimization in physics simulations).  \n- **Generative AI Pipelines**: Implement tools like foundation models for bioinformatics (e.g., protein structure prediction) and physics-based data augmentation.  \n- **Supercomputer-Friendly AI**: Optimize frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) for exascale systems, leveraging Pawsey’s GPU/accelerator infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Build Trusted Data Spaces**  \nLeverage Cineca’s emphasis on \"Data Spaces\" [1] to enable secure, FAIR-compliant data sharing:  \n- **Domain-Specific Data Platforms**: Create curated repositories for physics and bioinformatics data, ensuring interoperability with AI tools.  \n- **Data-AI Lifecycle Integration**: Automate data preprocessing, labeling, and model training pipelines (e.g., using Kubernetes for scalable workflows).  \n- **Ethical AI Governance**: Align with Australia’s AI Ethics Framework and the EU’s AI Act [1] for responsible data use.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Talent Development & Training**  \nAddress Cineca’s \"Talent & Competences\" priority [1] to upskill researchers:  \n- **AI Literacy Programs**: Offer workshops on AI/ML basics, focusing on scientific applications (e.g., bioinformatics pipelines, quantum simulation acceleration).  \n- **Advanced AI Developer Training**: Partner with universities to teach HPC-AI hybrid programming (e.g., CUDA, MPI + AI frameworks).  \n- **Residency Programs**: Host AI experts to collaborate on domain-specific projects (e.g., generative models for cosmology simulations).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Collaborative Innovation Ecosystem**  \nAdopt Cineca’s \"One Stop-Shop\" model [1] and global initiatives:  \n- **Industry-Academia Partnerships**: Collaborate with biotech, energy, and climate sectors to co-develop AI tools (e.g., drug discovery models).  \n- **National & Global Networks**: Integrate with Australia’s National AI Centre and the EU’s AI Factories initiative [1] for shared tooling and benchmarks.  \n- **Open Innovation Platforms**: Host challenges/hackathons to crowdsource AI solutions for grand challenges (e.g., pandemic modeling).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Scalable AI Infrastructure**  \nFuture-proof Pawsey’s systems for AI workloads:  \n- **AI-Dedicated Clusters**: Deploy GPU/TPU-accelerated nodes for large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in bioinformatics.  \n- **Edge-AI Integration**: Enable real-time AI analysis of streaming data (e.g., sensor data from physics experiments).  \n- **Sustainability Focus**: Optimize AI workloads for energy efficiency, aligning with Australia’s net-zero goals.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Metrics & Governance**  \n- **Impact Metrics**: Track AI-driven acceleration in discovery (e.g., reduced simulation time, novel biomarker identification).  \n- **Advisory Council**: Establish a board with scientists, AI ethicists, and industry reps to guide priorities.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Citations from Provided Context**  \n- Cineca’s \"AI Factory\" and \"Data Spaces\" [1] provide a blueprint for integrating AI with HPC workflows.  \n- EU’s focus on \"AI Ecosystems\" and \"Access & AI-HPC services\" [1] highlights the need for user-centric platforms.  \n- \"Talent & Competences\" [1] underscores the importance of training programs to bridge skill gaps.  \n\nThis strategy aligns with global trends (e.g., US National AI Research Resource, EuroHPC AI initiatives) while addressing Pawsey’s unique role in Australia’s research landscape.

Supercomputing Research Centre. They support 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want to accelerate scientific discovery.\n> \n> First, I need to look at the provided context. The sources mention Cineca's AI Strategy, focusing on AI Factories, Data Spaces, HPC systems, and EU's AI-oriented supercomputers. There's talk about One Stop-Shops, Talent & Competences, and Access & AI-HPC services. The sources are from Sanzio Bassini in March 2025 and November 2023, part of Cineca's SuperComputing Applications & Innovations. \n> \n> I should incorporate elements from Cineca's strategy, like creating an AI Factory and Data Spaces. Also, considering national AI strategies from the EU and Australia. The user mentioned other supercomputing centers, so maybe reference initiatives like the EU's AI Factories or the US's AI research resource programs.\n> \n> The strategy should have components like infrastructure, data management, talent development, collaboration, and ethical considerations. Each section can draw from the provided sources where applicable. For example, the AI Factory concept from Cineca [1], Data Spaces [1], and Talent & Competences [1]. Also, integrating national strategies like Australia's AI Ethics Framework and the EU's AI Act for compliance.\n> \n> Need to ensure that citations are only used when the source has an id. All provided sources have id=\"1\", so each mention of Cineca's strategy should cite [1]. Also, check if other elements like HPC integration with AI are covered in the sources. The context mentions HPC systems in the EU and AI-HPC services, so that's another cite [1].\n> \n> Make sure the strategy is actionable: building AI-dedicated infrastructure, creating data platforms, training programs, partnerships with industry and academia, and ensuring ethical AI use. Each point should link to the sources where possible. If some parts are based on my own knowledge (like US initiatives or Australian policies), explain that and don't cite unless the source has an id.\n> \n> Finally, structure the response with clear sections, use citations appropriately, and ensure it's tailored to Pawsey's specific context of supporting 4000 scientists in physics and bioinformatics.\n</details>\nBased on the provided context and global best practices, here's a strategy tailored to Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre's goals, incorporating insights from Cineca's AI Strategy [1] and international AI/HPC trends:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Establish an AI Factory Framework**  \nAdopt Cineca’s \"Data and AI Factory\" vision [1], integrating AI with HPC workflows to accelerate discovery:  \n- **AI-HPC Convergence**: Develop hybrid workflows combining physics-based simulations with AI/ML models (e.g., surrogate models for faster parameter optimization in physics simulations).  \n- **Generative AI Pipelines**: Implement tools like foundation models for bioinformatics (e.g., protein structure prediction) and physics-based data augmentation.  \n- **Supercomputer-Friendly AI**: Optimize frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) for exascale systems, leveraging Pawsey’s GPU/accelerator infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Build Trusted Data Spaces**  \nLeverage Cineca’s emphasis on \"Data Spaces\" [1] to enable secure, FAIR-compliant data sharing:  \n- **Domain-Specific Data Platforms**: Create curated repositories for physics and bioinformatics data, ensuring interoperability with AI tools.  \n- **Data-AI Lifecycle Integration**: Automate data preprocessing, labeling, and model training pipelines (e.g., using Kubernetes for scalable workflows).  \n- **Ethical AI Governance**: Align with Australia’s AI Ethics Framework and the EU’s AI Act [1] for responsible data use.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Talent Development & Training**  \nAddress Cineca’s \"Talent & Competences\" priority [1] to upskill researchers:  \n- **AI Literacy Programs**: Offer workshops on AI/ML basics, focusing on scientific applications (e.g., bioinformatics pipelines, quantum simulation acceleration).  \n- **Advanced AI Developer Training**: Partner with universities to teach HPC-AI hybrid programming (e.g., CUDA, MPI + AI frameworks).  \n- **Residency Programs**: Host AI experts to collaborate on domain-specific projects (e.g., generative models for cosmology simulations).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Collaborative Innovation Ecosystem**  \nAdopt Cineca’s \"One Stop-Shop\" model [1] and global initiatives:  \n- **Industry-Academia Partnerships**: Collaborate with biotech, energy, and climate sectors to co-develop AI tools (e.g., drug discovery models).  \n- **National & Global Networks**: Integrate with Australia’s National AI Centre and the EU’s AI Factories initiative [1] for shared tooling and benchmarks.  \n- **Open Innovation Platforms**: Host challenges/hackathons to crowdsource AI solutions for grand challenges (e.g., pandemic modeling).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Scalable AI Infrastructure**  \nFuture-proof Pawsey’s systems for AI workloads:  \n- **AI-Dedicated Clusters**: Deploy GPU/TPU-accelerated nodes for large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in bioinformatics.  \n- **Edge-AI Integration**: Enable real-time AI analysis of streaming data (e.g., sensor data from physics experiments).  \n- **Sustainability Focus**: Optimize AI workloads for energy efficiency, aligning with Australia’s net-zero goals.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Metrics & Governance**  \n- **Impact Metrics**: Track AI-driven acceleration in discovery (e.g., reduced simulation time, novel biomarker identification).  \n- **Advisory Council**: Establish a board with scientists, AI ethicists, and industry reps to guide priorities.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Citations from Provided Context**  \n- Cineca’s \"AI Factory\" and \"Data Spaces\" [1] provide a blueprint for integrating AI with HPC workflows.  \n- EU’s focus on \"AI Ecosystems\" and \"Access & AI-HPC services\" [1] highlights the need for user-centric platforms.  \n- \"Talent & Competences\" [1] underscores the importance of training programs to bridge skill gaps.  \n\nThis strategy aligns with global trends (e.g., US National AI Research Resource, EuroHPC AI initiatives) while addressing Pawsey’s unique role in Australia’s research landscape.

The goal is to accelerate scientific discovery using AI and generative AI techniques. Let me start by recalling the information provided and any relevant external knowledge about other supercomputing centers and national AI strategies.\n> \n> First, I should consider the current landscape of AI in supercomputing. Many supercomputing centers, like the US's Oak Ridge or Europe's EuroHPC, have started integrating AI with traditional HPC to handle complex simulations and data analysis. Australia's own AI strategy might emphasize collaboration, ethics, and key research areas like health and environment.\n> \n> The users here are scientists running physics simulations and bioinformatics workloads. So, AI could help in areas like optimizing simulations, automating data analysis, or generating models. I need to structure the strategy around the center's existing capabilities and the users' needs.\n> \n> Possible areas to cover in the strategy:\n> 1. Infrastructure: Ensuring the supercomputers are equipped with AI-accelerated hardware (GPUs, TPUs) and scalable storage.\n> 2. Software and Tools: Providing AI frameworks, libraries, and possibly developing domain-specific tools.\n> 3. Collaboration and Partnerships: Working with academia, industry, and government to align with national AI strategies and leverage external expertise.\n> 4. Skills Development: Training programs and support for researchers to use AI tools effectively.\n> 5. Ethical AI and Governance: Ensuring responsible use of AI, especially with generative models.\n> 6. Application-Specific Solutions: Tailoring AI solutions for physics and bioinformatics, maybe even cross-disciplinary projects.\n> 7. Innovation and R&D: Encouraging exploratory research with AI, maybe through grants or pilot projects.\n> 8. Support Services: Dedicated AI support teams, consulting services for integrating AI into workflows.\n> \n> I should check if there are any gaps here. Maybe data management? Handling the data lifecycle is crucial for AI, especially in bioinformatics. Also, integration with existing HPC workflows. How do other centers handle hybrid workflows combining simulation and AI?\n> \n> National strategies often emphasize ethical AI, workforce development, and key sectors. Australia's strategy might focus on areas like health, energy, agriculture, which aligns with bioinformatics and physics. So the strategy should link AI initiatives to these national priorities.\n> \n> Potential challenges: Ensuring the AI models are accurate and reliable in scientific contexts, where errors can have big impacts. Also, user adoption – researchers might be hesitant or lack skills. Training and collaboration with domain experts would be key.\n> \n> Structure of the strategy document: Maybe start with a vision, then objectives, followed by pillars or focus areas, each with actions, and then implementation steps with timelines and KPIs.\n> \n> Wait, the user mentioned uploaded content. Since I don't have access to that, I should note that the strategy should be tailored considering their specific existing resources and user needs, which might be detailed in the uploaded info. But since I can't reference that, I'll proceed with general best practices and known strategies.\n> \n> Let me outline the strategy with sections like Vision, Guiding Principles, Strategic Pillars with Actions, Implementation Roadmap, Governance, etc.\n> \n> Vision: Position Pawsey as a leader in AI-augmented scientific discovery in Australia.\n> \n> Guiding Principles: User-centric, ethical, collaborative, sustainable, innovative.\n> \n> Strategic Pillars:\n> 1. Advanced AI Infrastructure\n> 2. Domain-Specific AI Development\n> 3. Skills and Workforce Development\n> 4. Collaborative Ecosystems\n> 5. Ethical and Responsible AI\n> \n> Under each pillar, specific actions. For example, under Infrastructure: Upgrade hardware, provide cloud-based AI tools, optimize storage.\n> \n> In Domain-Specific AI: Develop AI models for physics simulations (like surrogate models), bioinformatics pipelines, integrate AI with existing simulation codes.\n> \n> Skills Development: Workshops, training programs, hiring AI specialists.\n> \n> Collaboration: Partner with Australian Research Council, CSIRO, universities, industry partners in key sectors.\n> \n> Ethical AI: Frameworks for validation, transparency, bias mitigation, especially in generative AI which can create novel data or models.\n> \n> Implementation Roadmap could have phases over 1-3 years, starting with needs assessment, then pilot projects, scaling up, and continuous improvement.\n> \n> KPIs: Number of AI projects supported, user satisfaction, research outputs, partnerships formed, training delivered.\n> \n> I should also consider case studies from other centers. For instance, Argonne National Lab uses AI for materials discovery, combining simulations with ML. Pawsey could target similar approaches in their domains.\n> \n> Need to ensure that the AI services are integrated seamlessly into existing workflows, so working closely with current user communities to understand their pain points.\n> \n> Another point: Generative AI might be used for creating synthetic data for training models, generating hypotheses, or automating code writing. Supporting such use cases would be beneficial.\n> \n> Data governance is important too – ensuring data quality, provenance, and accessibility for AI models.\n> \n> I think that covers the main points. Now structure this into a coherent strategy document with clear sections and actionable steps.\n</details>\n**Strategy for Implementing and Supporting AI Services at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre**  \n**Vision:** To position Pawsey as a national leader in AI-augmented scientific discovery, accelerating research outcomes for Australian scientists through ethical, collaborative, and innovative AI integration.\n\n---\n\n### **Guiding Principles**  \n1. **User-Centric Focus:** Tailor AI solutions to address domain-specific challenges in physics simulations and bioinformatics.  \n2. **Ethical and Responsible AI:** Prioritize transparency, fairness, and reproducibility, particularly in generative AI applications.  \n3. **Collaborative Innovation:** Partner with academia, industry, and government to align with Australia’s National AI Strategy and research priorities.  \n4. **Sustainability:** Ensure scalable, energy-efficient AI infrastructure and practices.  \n5. **Workforce Empowerment:** Equip researchers with skills to adopt AI tools effectively.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Pillars & Actions**  \n\n#### **1.

The goal is to accelerate scientific discovery using AI and generative AI techniques. Let me start by recalling the information provided and any relevant external knowledge about other supercomputing centers and national AI strategies.\n> \n> First, I should consider the current landscape of AI in supercomputing. Many supercomputing centers, like the US's Oak Ridge or Europe's EuroHPC, have started integrating AI with traditional HPC to handle complex simulations and data analysis. Australia's own AI strategy might emphasize collaboration, ethics, and key research areas like health and environment.\n> \n> The users here are scientists running physics simulations and bioinformatics workloads. So, AI could help in areas like optimizing simulations, automating data analysis, or generating models. I need to structure the strategy around the center's existing capabilities and the users' needs.\n> \n> Possible areas to cover in the strategy:\n> 1. Infrastructure: Ensuring the supercomputers are equipped with AI-accelerated hardware (GPUs, TPUs) and scalable storage.\n> 2. Software and Tools: Providing AI frameworks, libraries, and possibly developing domain-specific tools.\n> 3. Collaboration and Partnerships: Working with academia, industry, and government to align with national AI strategies and leverage external expertise.\n> 4. Skills Development: Training programs and support for researchers to use AI tools effectively.\n> 5. Ethical AI and Governance: Ensuring responsible use of AI, especially with generative models.\n> 6. Application-Specific Solutions: Tailoring AI solutions for physics and bioinformatics, maybe even cross-disciplinary projects.\n> 7. Innovation and R&D: Encouraging exploratory research with AI, maybe through grants or pilot projects.\n> 8. Support Services: Dedicated AI support teams, consulting services for integrating AI into workflows.\n> \n> I should check if there are any gaps here. Maybe data management? Handling the data lifecycle is crucial for AI, especially in bioinformatics. Also, integration with existing HPC workflows. How do other centers handle hybrid workflows combining simulation and AI?\n> \n> National strategies often emphasize ethical AI, workforce development, and key sectors. Australia's strategy might focus on areas like health, energy, agriculture, which aligns with bioinformatics and physics. So the strategy should link AI initiatives to these national priorities.\n> \n> Potential challenges: Ensuring the AI models are accurate and reliable in scientific contexts, where errors can have big impacts. Also, user adoption – researchers might be hesitant or lack skills. Training and collaboration with domain experts would be key.\n> \n> Structure of the strategy document: Maybe start with a vision, then objectives, followed by pillars or focus areas, each with actions, and then implementation steps with timelines and KPIs.\n> \n> Wait, the user mentioned uploaded content. Since I don't have access to that, I should note that the strategy should be tailored considering their specific existing resources and user needs, which might be detailed in the uploaded info. But since I can't reference that, I'll proceed with general best practices and known strategies.\n> \n> Let me outline the strategy with sections like Vision, Guiding Principles, Strategic Pillars with Actions, Implementation Roadmap, Governance, etc.\n> \n> Vision: Position Pawsey as a leader in AI-augmented scientific discovery in Australia.\n> \n> Guiding Principles: User-centric, ethical, collaborative, sustainable, innovative.\n> \n> Strategic Pillars:\n> 1. Advanced AI Infrastructure\n> 2. Domain-Specific AI Development\n> 3. Skills and Workforce Development\n> 4. Collaborative Ecosystems\n> 5. Ethical and Responsible AI\n> \n> Under each pillar, specific actions. For example, under Infrastructure: Upgrade hardware, provide cloud-based AI tools, optimize storage.\n> \n> In Domain-Specific AI: Develop AI models for physics simulations (like surrogate models), bioinformatics pipelines, integrate AI with existing simulation codes.\n> \n> Skills Development: Workshops, training programs, hiring AI specialists.\n> \n> Collaboration: Partner with Australian Research Council, CSIRO, universities, industry partners in key sectors.\n> \n> Ethical AI: Frameworks for validation, transparency, bias mitigation, especially in generative AI which can create novel data or models.\n> \n> Implementation Roadmap could have phases over 1-3 years, starting with needs assessment, then pilot projects, scaling up, and continuous improvement.\n> \n> KPIs: Number of AI projects supported, user satisfaction, research outputs, partnerships formed, training delivered.\n> \n> I should also consider case studies from other centers. For instance, Argonne National Lab uses AI for materials discovery, combining simulations with ML. Pawsey could target similar approaches in their domains.\n> \n> Need to ensure that the AI services are integrated seamlessly into existing workflows, so working closely with current user communities to understand their pain points.\n> \n> Another point: Generative AI might be used for creating synthetic data for training models, generating hypotheses, or automating code writing. Supporting such use cases would be beneficial.\n> \n> Data governance is important too – ensuring data quality, provenance, and accessibility for AI models.\n> \n> I think that covers the main points. Now structure this into a coherent strategy document with clear sections and actionable steps.\n</details>\n**Strategy for Implementing and Supporting AI Services at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre**  \n**Vision:** To position Pawsey as a national leader in AI-augmented scientific discovery, accelerating research outcomes for Australian scientists through ethical, collaborative, and innovative AI integration.\n\n---\n\n### **Guiding Principles**  \n1. **User-Centric Focus:** Tailor AI solutions to address domain-specific challenges in physics simulations and bioinformatics.  \n2. **Ethical and Responsible AI:** Prioritize transparency, fairness, and reproducibility, particularly in generative AI applications.  \n3. **Collaborative Innovation:** Partner with academia, industry, and government to align with Australia’s National AI Strategy and research priorities.  \n4. **Sustainability:** Ensure scalable, energy-efficient AI infrastructure and practices.  \n5. **Workforce Empowerment:** Equip researchers with skills to adopt AI tools effectively.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Pillars & Actions**  \n\n#### **1.

Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They wanted a strategy, and now they need the infrastructure details.\n> \n> First, I should check the context provided earlier. The sources mention CINECA's use of heterogeneous exascale systems, GPUs for AI workloads, high-speed storage, and networks. Also, terms like \"AI Factory\" and \"MLOps pipelines\" were in the previous response. \n> \n> The user is from Pawsey, which supports scientific research with simulations and bioinformatics. They need infrastructure that supports both HPC and AI. So, I need to outline components like compute systems (GPUs, CPUs, maybe TPUs), storage solutions, networking, and software.\n> \n> Compute: The context mentioned NVIDIA GPUs like A100 and H100 for AI/ML workloads. Heterogeneous systems with CPUs and GPUs are important for scaling, as per CINECA's approach. Maybe also mention exascale systems since the source talked about exascale challenges.\n> \n> Storage: The sources highlighted fast storage and data lakes. High-throughput storage like NVMe SSDs and parallel file systems (Lustre?) are common in HPC. Data lakes for unstructured data in AI.\n> \n> Network: High-speed interconnects like NVLink and InfiniBand. The context mentioned tightly coupled accelerators, so low-latency networks are crucial.\n> \n> Software: AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), MLOps tools (MLflow, Kubeflow), and integration with HPC workflows. The previous response talked about MLOps pipelines, so that's relevant.\n> \n> Cooling and Power: Supercomputers need efficient cooling. Liquid cooling could be a point here, as mentioned in the sources indirectly.\n> \n> Security: Data governance and compliance, especially for bioinformatics data. The context didn't mention this, but it's a standard part of infrastructure.\n> \n> I need to structure each section: Compute, Storage, Network, Software, Cooling, Security. Use bullet points with citations where applicable. The sources have IDs, so check which parts have [1] or [2] citations.\n> \n> Wait, in the context, the sources are all id=\"1\", but in the previous answer, some points cited [1] and [2]. Maybe the user uploaded multiple sources, but in the context here, all are under id=\"1\". So I should only cite [1] where the source has an id. Let me verify the original context.\n> \n> Looking back, the context has three sources, all with id=\"1\". So any citation should be [1]. For example, when talking about heterogeneous systems, storage, and network, if the info is from the source, cite [1]. Other parts like software or security might not be in the sources, so don't cite those.\n> \n> Make sure not to use XML tags and keep citations concise. Also, if a point isn't in the sources, don't cite it. For example, mentioning specific GPU models like A100 might be from the assistant's knowledge, so no citation. But the need for heterogeneous systems is from the source, so cite [1].\n> \n> Putting it all together, the response should list each infrastructure component with relevant details and citations where applicable. Avoid markdown, use clear sections. Check for any missing info and ensure alignment with the user's needs in scientific HPC and AI.\n</details>\nBased on the context provided and general HPC/AI infrastructure requirements, here’s a breakdown of the IT infrastructure needed:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Compute Systems**  \n- **Heterogeneous Supercomputers**: Systems combining CPUs (e.g., AMD EPYC, Intel Xeon) and GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100/H100) to handle both traditional HPC simulations and AI/ML workloads. CINECA’s Exscalate platform demonstrates the need for scaling on heterogeneous exascale systems [1].  \n- **AI-Optimized Accelerators**: High-performance GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H100, Hopper architecture) or TPUs for deep learning tasks like protein prediction or generative AI in bioinformatics.  \n- **Edge/Cluster Nodes**: For distributed AI training/inference pipelines, especially in hybrid cloud environments (e.g., CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" architecture) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Storage**  \n- **High-Speed Storage**: NVMe SSDs and parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre, BeeGFS) to support AI/ML data pipelines and real-time access to large datasets (e.g., 70 billion compounds screened in 60 hours by CINECA) [1].  \n- **Data Lakes**: Scalable object storage (e.g., S3-compatible systems) for unstructured data in bioinformatics and physics simulations.  \n- **Tiered Storage**: Fast storage for active AI training and slower archival storage for long-term data retention.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Networking**  \n- **High-Bandwidth Interconnects**: NVLink for GPU-GPU communication and InfiniBand (e.g., NVIDIA Quantum) for low-latency, high-throughput cluster networking.  \n- **Hybrid Cloud Integration**: Secure, high-speed connectivity to external clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure) for burst capacity or collaborative projects (e.g., Novartis on AWS) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Software Stack**  \n- **AI Frameworks**: Pre-installed libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) and domain-specific tools (e.g., NVIDIA BioNemo for life sciences, CelerityIQ for physics simulations).  \n- **MLOps Platforms**: Tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, or CINECA’s tightly coupled accelerator workflows to manage AI model training, tuning, and deployment [1].  \n- **HPC-AI Integration**: Middleware (e.g., Slurm, Kubernetes) to unify HPC and AI workloads on shared infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Cooling and Power**  \n- **Liquid Cooling**: For high-density GPU clusters to manage exascale-level power consumption (e.g., CINECA’s supercomputers).  \n- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Align with national sustainability goals for energy-efficient AI/HPC operations.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Security and Governance**  \n- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive bioinformatics or clinical datasets.  \n- **Access Control**: Role-based authentication for AI tools and HPC resources.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations from the Context:  \n- **Scalability**: Systems must scale to handle exascale AI workloads (e.g., 70 billion compound screenings in 60 hours) [1].  \n- **Hybrid Architecture**: Balance between on-premises HPC and cloud services for flexibility (e.g., CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" model) [1].  \n\nThis infrastructure aligns with CINECA’s approach to AI/HPC integration and global trends in exascale computing for scientific discovery.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749747178,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"193\">\n<summary>Thought for 193 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user is asking about the skills and experience needed for staff to operate the infrastructure and support scientists in AI-enabled workflows. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They work at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre and want to integrate AI into their services. Earlier, I provided a strategy and infrastructure details, so now they're focusing on human resources.\n> \n> First, I need to connect this to the context provided earlier. The context included sources from CINECA and other supercomputing centers, mentioning roles like AI Research Assistants and the need for skilled staff in HPC and AI. Also, there was mention of training programs and collaboration with industry.\n> \n> The user needs to know what kind of expertise their staff should have. I should break it down into operational staff and support staff for scientists. \n> \n> For operating the infrastructure, staff need HPC and AI/ML expertise. They should be familiar with hardware like GPUs, software stacks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and tools like Slurm. Maybe mention specific examples from the context, like CINECA's AI Factories and their need for programming facilities.\n> \n> For supporting scientists, staff should have domain-specific knowledge in areas like bioinformatics or physics. They need to co-design workflows, so collaboration skills and understanding of MLOps would be important. Also, training scientists in AI tools, referencing the June 2025 training programs mentioned earlier.\n> \n> I should also include soft skills like problem-solving and communication. The user might need to know about training programs or partnerships with academia and industry. Maybe mention the Innovation Gate initiatives for cross-sector collaboration.\n> \n> Wait, the context had sources with id=\"1\" and id=\"2\". Need to check which ones to cite. For example, the AI Factories and HPC integration from source id=\"1\", and the AI Research Assistants from id=\"2\". Also, the training programs in June 2025 from source id=\"1\".\n> \n> Make sure to structure the answer clearly, separating operational skills from support roles, and include citations where applicable. Also, mention the need for continuous learning due to fast-evolving AI tech. Maybe add examples like NVIDIA BioNemo or CelerityIQ tools from the context.\n> \n> Check if there's anything missing. The user might also be interested in leadership and project management skills for managing AI projects. Also, ethical considerations in AI, which were part of the strategy's governance section. But the current query is about staff experience and skills, so focus on technical and domain-specific aspects.\n> \n> Alright, structure the answer into sections for infrastructure operation and scientist support, list required skills with examples, and add citations where the sources have ids. Avoid using markdown and ensure clarity.\n</details>\nCertainly! The staff required to operate AI/HPC infrastructure and support scientists in co-designing AI-enabled workflows need a blend of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and collaborative skills. Below is a breakdown based on the context provided and global best practices:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Skills for Operating AI/HPC Infrastructure**  \n- **HPC Systems Management**:  \n  - Deep understanding of cluster administration (e.g., Slurm, Kubernetes), GPU programming (CUDA, OpenACC), and high-performance storage systems (e.g., Lustre, BeeGFS) [1].  \n  - Experience with AI-optimized hardware (e.g., NVIDIA H100 GPUs, TPUs) and interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand, NVLink) to ensure low-latency communication for distributed AI training [1].  \n- **AI/ML Engineering**:  \n  - Proficiency in frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and domain-specific tools (e.g., NVIDIA BioNemo for life sciences, CelerityIQ for physics simulations) [1][2].  \n  - Knowledge of MLOps pipelines (e.g., MLflow, Kubeflow) to deploy and optimize AI models at scale, as seen in CINECA’s tightly coupled workflows [1].  \n- **Infrastructure Modernization**:  \n  - Expertise in hybrid cloud integration (e.g., AWS, Azure) and containerization (e.g., Docker, Singularity) to support flexible workflows like CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" model [1].  \n  - Familiarity with liquid cooling systems and renewable energy strategies for sustainable exascale operations [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Skills for Supporting Scientists**  \n- **Domain-Specific AI Expertise**:  \n  - Understanding of physics simulations (e.g., fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics) and bioinformatics (e.g., genomics, protein folding) to co-design AI-augmented workflows [2].  \n  - Ability to translate scientific challenges into AI/ML solutions (e.g., using generative AI for drug discovery, as CINECA did with Dompé Farmaceutici) [1].  \n- **Workflow Co-Design**:  \n  - Experience in optimizing AI/HPC workflows for performance and scalability, such as accelerating compound screening pipelines from months to hours [1].  \n  - Skills in debugging and optimizing hybrid workloads (e.g., integrating NVIDIA BioNemo with traditional HPC simulations) [1].  \n- **Training and Consultation**:  \n  - Pedagogical skills to deliver workshops (e.g., Pawsey’s June 2025 AI training programs) and create tutorials for tools like CelerityIQ or BioNemo [2].  \n  - Ability to provide \"expert advice\" on AI ethics, data privacy, and reproducibility in scientific workflows [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Soft Skills and Collaboration**  \n- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**:  \n  - Experience working with academia, industry, and government, akin to CINECA’s \"Innovation Gate\" initiatives for public-private partnerships [1].  \n  - Communication skills to bridge the gap between AI developers, HPC engineers, and domain scientists.  \n- **Problem-Solving and Adaptability**:  \n  - Flexibility to address rapidly evolving AI technologies (e.g., transitioning from A100 to H100 GPUs) and emerging use cases (e.g., AI for climate modeling).  \n- **Leadership and Governance**:  \n  - Project management skills to oversee AI infrastructure upgrades or co-design initiatives, aligned with national AI strategies (e.g., Australia’s ethical AI frameworks) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Training and Development Needs**  \n- **Continuous Learning**:  \n  - Access to programs like the U.S. DOE’s \"1000 Scientists Challenge\" to stay updated on generative AI trends and tools [2].  \n  - Certifications in AI/ML (e.g., NVIDIA DLI, AWS Machine Learning Specialty).  \n- **Hands-On Experience**:  \n  - Exposure to real-world AI/HPC projects, such as CINECA’s Exscalate platform for drug discovery or Pawsey’s physics simulations [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from the Context**  \n- **AI Factories and One-Stop-Shops**: Staff must support \"Data and AI Factories\" by integrating pre-installed AI environments and providing unified access to tools [1].  \n- **Talent Development**: The EU’s focus on \"Talent & Competences\" highlights the need for upskilling staff in AI-HPC convergence [1].  \n\nBy aligning staff expertise with these areas, Pawsey can ensure its infrastructure and support teams are future-ready for AI-driven scientific discovery.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749747948,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"152\">\n<summary>Thought for 152 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user is from the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Australia. They support 4000 scientists doing physics simulations and bioinformatics. They want to use AI and GenAI to speed up scientific discovery. They need a strategy that incorporates the provided context, other supercomputing centers' info, and national AI strategies.\n> \n> First, I need to look at the context they provided. There are three sources. The first two mention CINECA's integration of AI in HPC for drug discovery, challenges like model deployment (MLOps), and their partnership with Dompé Farmaceutici. They also mention EU's AI-oriented supercomputers and moving towards a Data and AI Factory. The third source talks about CSCS and CelerityIQ slides from AI training at Pawsey in June 2025, mentioning the 1000 scientists challenge by the US DOE using generative AI for scientific workflows. There's also a link to AI-generated simulations on single nodes.\n> \n> So, key points from context: AI integration in HPC workflows, MLOps challenges, collaboration with industry, training programs, and examples from CINECA, CSCS, and US DOE initiatives.\n> \n> Now, the user wants a strategy. I should structure it into sections. Let's think about the main areas they need to address.\n> \n> 1. **Infrastructure and Integration**: Based on CINECA's approach, integrating AI models into HPC simulations using MLOps. Also, the EU's Data and AI Factory concept. Pawsey should invest in scalable infrastructure that supports both AI and traditional HPC workloads. Maybe hybrid systems for AI/ML and HPC.\n> \n> 2. **Collaboration and Industry Partnerships**: CINECA partners with pharma companies and Dompé Farmaceutici. Pawsey could establish similar partnerships, especially with Australian industries. Also, the Innovation Gate for private and public institutions mentioned in the context.\n> \n> 3. **Training and Workforce Development**: The US DOE's 1000 scientists challenge and Pawsey's own AI training in June 2025. They need to expand training programs for researchers and industry partners, focusing on GenAI applications in scientific discovery.\n> \n> 4. **Software and Tools Development**: The context mentions NVIDIA's BioNemo and CelerityIQ tools. Pawsey should develop or adopt AI frameworks tailored for their domains (physics, bioinformatics). Pre-installed software like on Setonix could be a model.\n> \n> 5. **National and International Alignment**: Align with Australia's AI strategy and EU's AI-oriented supercomputers. Participate in global initiatives and share best practices with centers like CSCS and CINECA.\n> \n> 6. **Ethical and Responsible AI**: Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines, transparency, and data governance. Important for bioinformatics and sensitive data.\n> \n> 7. **Research and Innovation**: Support exploratory projects like the 1000 scientists challenge, encouraging use of GenAI in simulations and data analysis.\n> \n> Wait, the user mentioned using info from other centers and national strategies. I should include examples from US DOE, EU's strategies, and maybe mention Australia's national AI strategy if applicable. Also, check if the sources have IDs. The first two sources have id=\"1\", the third id=\"2\". So citations would be [1] and [2].\n> \n> Potential structure:\n> \n> 1. **Infrastructure Modernization**: Integrate AI-optimized hardware, hybrid HPC-AI systems, MLOps pipelines [1].\n> \n> 2. **Collaborative Ecosystem**: Partner with industry and academia, like CINECA-Dompé collaboration [1], Innovation Gate [1].\n> \n> 3. **Training Programs**: Expand AI literacy, workshops based on Pawsey's 2025 training [2], US DOE's challenge [2].\n> \n> 4. **Tailored AI Tools**: Adopt frameworks like NVIDIA BioNemo [1], develop domain-specific tools [2].\n> \n> 5. **National/Global Alignment**: Align with Australia's AI strategy, EU's Data Factory [1], collaborate internationally.\n> \n> 6. **Ethics and Governance**: Ensure responsible AI use, data privacy.\n> \n> 7. **Innovation Funding**: Support pilot projects using GenAI, inspired by US DOE's initiative [2].\n> \n> Each section should reference the relevant sources where applicable. For example, when talking about MLOps and integration challenges, cite [1]. When mentioning training and the 1000 scientists challenge, cite [2]. The Innovation Gate and partnerships also from [1].\n> \n> Need to make sure that citations are only used where the source has an id. The third source has id=\"2\", so when mentioning the US DOE challenge and CelerityIQ training, that's [2]. The EU's AI supercomputers and CINECA's work are [1].\n> \n> Also, the user mentioned their own training in June 2025, which is in the third source [2], so that should be cited when talking about expanding training programs.\n> \n> Make sure the strategy is actionable and specific to Pawsey's context, leveraging their existing initiatives (like the 2025 training) and examples from other centers.\n</details>\nHere’s a draft strategy for Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre to implement AI and Generative AI services, informed by the provided context, global supercomputing practices, and national AI strategies:\n\n---\n\n### **1.

Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They wanted a strategy, and now they need the infrastructure details.\n> \n> First, I should check the context provided earlier. The sources mention CINECA's use of heterogeneous exascale systems, GPUs for AI workloads, high-speed storage, and networks. Also, terms like \"AI Factory\" and \"MLOps pipelines\" were in the previous response. \n> \n> The user is from Pawsey, which supports scientific research with simulations and bioinformatics. They need infrastructure that supports both HPC and AI. So, I need to outline components like compute systems (GPUs, CPUs, maybe TPUs), storage solutions, networking, and software.\n> \n> Compute: The context mentioned NVIDIA GPUs like A100 and H100 for AI/ML workloads. Heterogeneous systems with CPUs and GPUs are important for scaling, as per CINECA's approach. Maybe also mention exascale systems since the source talked about exascale challenges.\n> \n> Storage: The sources highlighted fast storage and data lakes. High-throughput storage like NVMe SSDs and parallel file systems (Lustre?) are common in HPC. Data lakes for unstructured data in AI.\n> \n> Network: High-speed interconnects like NVLink and InfiniBand. The context mentioned tightly coupled accelerators, so low-latency networks are crucial.\n> \n> Software: AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), MLOps tools (MLflow, Kubeflow), and integration with HPC workflows. The previous response talked about MLOps pipelines, so that's relevant.\n> \n> Cooling and Power: Supercomputers need efficient cooling. Liquid cooling could be a point here, as mentioned in the sources indirectly.\n> \n> Security: Data governance and compliance, especially for bioinformatics data. The context didn't mention this, but it's a standard part of infrastructure.\n> \n> I need to structure each section: Compute, Storage, Network, Software, Cooling, Security. Use bullet points with citations where applicable. The sources have IDs, so check which parts have [1] or [2] citations.\n> \n> Wait, in the context, the sources are all id=\"1\", but in the previous answer, some points cited [1] and [2]. Maybe the user uploaded multiple sources, but in the context here, all are under id=\"1\". So I should only cite [1] where the source has an id. Let me verify the original context.\n> \n> Looking back, the context has three sources, all with id=\"1\". So any citation should be [1]. For example, when talking about heterogeneous systems, storage, and network, if the info is from the source, cite [1]. Other parts like software or security might not be in the sources, so don't cite those.\n> \n> Make sure not to use XML tags and keep citations concise. Also, if a point isn't in the sources, don't cite it. For example, mentioning specific GPU models like A100 might be from the assistant's knowledge, so no citation. But the need for heterogeneous systems is from the source, so cite [1].\n> \n> Putting it all together, the response should list each infrastructure component with relevant details and citations where applicable. Avoid markdown, use clear sections. Check for any missing info and ensure alignment with the user's needs in scientific HPC and AI.\n</details>\nBased on the context provided and general HPC/AI infrastructure requirements, here’s a breakdown of the IT infrastructure needed:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Compute Systems**  \n- **Heterogeneous Supercomputers**: Systems combining CPUs (e.g., AMD EPYC, Intel Xeon) and GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100/H100) to handle both traditional HPC simulations and AI/ML workloads. CINECA’s Exscalate platform demonstrates the need for scaling on heterogeneous exascale systems [1].  \n- **AI-Optimized Accelerators**: High-performance GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H100, Hopper architecture) or TPUs for deep learning tasks like protein prediction or generative AI in bioinformatics.  \n- **Edge/Cluster Nodes**: For distributed AI training/inference pipelines, especially in hybrid cloud environments (e.g., CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" architecture) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Storage**  \n- **High-Speed Storage**: NVMe SSDs and parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre, BeeGFS) to support AI/ML data pipelines and real-time access to large datasets (e.g., 70 billion compounds screened in 60 hours by CINECA) [1].  \n- **Data Lakes**: Scalable object storage (e.g., S3-compatible systems) for unstructured data in bioinformatics and physics simulations.  \n- **Tiered Storage**: Fast storage for active AI training and slower archival storage for long-term data retention.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Networking**  \n- **High-Bandwidth Interconnects**: NVLink for GPU-GPU communication and InfiniBand (e.g., NVIDIA Quantum) for low-latency, high-throughput cluster networking.  \n- **Hybrid Cloud Integration**: Secure, high-speed connectivity to external clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure) for burst capacity or collaborative projects (e.g., Novartis on AWS) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Software Stack**  \n- **AI Frameworks**: Pre-installed libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) and domain-specific tools (e.g., NVIDIA BioNemo for life sciences, CelerityIQ for physics simulations).  \n- **MLOps Platforms**: Tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, or CINECA’s tightly coupled accelerator workflows to manage AI model training, tuning, and deployment [1].  \n- **HPC-AI Integration**: Middleware (e.g., Slurm, Kubernetes) to unify HPC and AI workloads on shared infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Cooling and Power**  \n- **Liquid Cooling**: For high-density GPU clusters to manage exascale-level power consumption (e.g., CINECA’s supercomputers).  \n- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Align with national sustainability goals for energy-efficient AI/HPC operations.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Security and Governance**  \n- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive bioinformatics or clinical datasets.  \n- **Access Control**: Role-based authentication for AI tools and HPC resources.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations from the Context:  \n- **Scalability**: Systems must scale to handle exascale AI workloads (e.g., 70 billion compound screenings in 60 hours) [1].  \n- **Hybrid Architecture**: Balance between on-premises HPC and cloud services for flexibility (e.g., CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" model) [1].  \n\nThis infrastructure aligns with CINECA’s approach to AI/HPC integration and global trends in exascale computing for scientific discovery.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749747178,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"193\">\n<summary>Thought for 193 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user is asking about the skills and experience needed for staff to operate the infrastructure and support scientists in AI-enabled workflows. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They work at Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre and want to integrate AI into their services. Earlier, I provided a strategy and infrastructure details, so now they're focusing on human resources.\n> \n> First, I need to connect this to the context provided earlier. The context included sources from CINECA and other supercomputing centers, mentioning roles like AI Research Assistants and the need for skilled staff in HPC and AI. Also, there was mention of training programs and collaboration with industry.\n> \n> The user needs to know what kind of expertise their staff should have. I should break it down into operational staff and support staff for scientists. \n> \n> For operating the infrastructure, staff need HPC and AI/ML expertise. They should be familiar with hardware like GPUs, software stacks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and tools like Slurm. Maybe mention specific examples from the context, like CINECA's AI Factories and their need for programming facilities.\n> \n> For supporting scientists, staff should have domain-specific knowledge in areas like bioinformatics or physics. They need to co-design workflows, so collaboration skills and understanding of MLOps would be important. Also, training scientists in AI tools, referencing the June 2025 training programs mentioned earlier.\n> \n> I should also include soft skills like problem-solving and communication. The user might need to know about training programs or partnerships with academia and industry. Maybe mention the Innovation Gate initiatives for cross-sector collaboration.\n> \n> Wait, the context had sources with id=\"1\" and id=\"2\". Need to check which ones to cite. For example, the AI Factories and HPC integration from source id=\"1\", and the AI Research Assistants from id=\"2\". Also, the training programs in June 2025 from source id=\"1\".\n> \n> Make sure to structure the answer clearly, separating operational skills from support roles, and include citations where applicable. Also, mention the need for continuous learning due to fast-evolving AI tech. Maybe add examples like NVIDIA BioNemo or CelerityIQ tools from the context.\n> \n> Check if there's anything missing. The user might also be interested in leadership and project management skills for managing AI projects. Also, ethical considerations in AI, which were part of the strategy's governance section. But the current query is about staff experience and skills, so focus on technical and domain-specific aspects.\n> \n> Alright, structure the answer into sections for infrastructure operation and scientist support, list required skills with examples, and add citations where the sources have ids. Avoid using markdown and ensure clarity.\n</details>\nCertainly! The staff required to operate AI/HPC infrastructure and support scientists in co-designing AI-enabled workflows need a blend of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and collaborative skills. Below is a breakdown based on the context provided and global best practices:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Skills for Operating AI/HPC Infrastructure**  \n- **HPC Systems Management**:  \n  - Deep understanding of cluster administration (e.g., Slurm, Kubernetes), GPU programming (CUDA, OpenACC), and high-performance storage systems (e.g., Lustre, BeeGFS) [1].  \n  - Experience with AI-optimized hardware (e.g., NVIDIA H100 GPUs, TPUs) and interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand, NVLink) to ensure low-latency communication for distributed AI training [1].  \n- **AI/ML Engineering**:  \n  - Proficiency in frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and domain-specific tools (e.g., NVIDIA BioNemo for life sciences, CelerityIQ for physics simulations) [1][2].  \n  - Knowledge of MLOps pipelines (e.g., MLflow, Kubeflow) to deploy and optimize AI models at scale, as seen in CINECA’s tightly coupled workflows [1].  \n- **Infrastructure Modernization**:  \n  - Expertise in hybrid cloud integration (e.g., AWS, Azure) and containerization (e.g., Docker, Singularity) to support flexible workflows like CINECA’s \"AI Factory\" model [1].  \n  - Familiarity with liquid cooling systems and renewable energy strategies for sustainable exascale operations [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Skills for Supporting Scientists**  \n- **Domain-Specific AI Expertise**:  \n  - Understanding of physics simulations (e.g., fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics) and bioinformatics (e.g., genomics, protein folding) to co-design AI-augmented workflows [2].  \n  - Ability to translate scientific challenges into AI/ML solutions (e.g., using generative AI for drug discovery, as CINECA did with Dompé Farmaceutici) [1].  \n- **Workflow Co-Design**:  \n  - Experience in optimizing AI/HPC workflows for performance and scalability, such as accelerating compound screening pipelines from months to hours [1].  \n  - Skills in debugging and optimizing hybrid workloads (e.g., integrating NVIDIA BioNemo with traditional HPC simulations) [1].  \n- **Training and Consultation**:  \n  - Pedagogical skills to deliver workshops (e.g., Pawsey’s June 2025 AI training programs) and create tutorials for tools like CelerityIQ or BioNemo [2].  \n  - Ability to provide \"expert advice\" on AI ethics, data privacy, and reproducibility in scientific workflows [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Soft Skills and Collaboration**  \n- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**:  \n  - Experience working with academia, industry, and government, akin to CINECA’s \"Innovation Gate\" initiatives for public-private partnerships [1].  \n  - Communication skills to bridge the gap between AI developers, HPC engineers, and domain scientists.  \n- **Problem-Solving and Adaptability**:  \n  - Flexibility to address rapidly evolving AI technologies (e.g., transitioning from A100 to H100 GPUs) and emerging use cases (e.g., AI for climate modeling).  \n- **Leadership and Governance**:  \n  - Project management skills to oversee AI infrastructure upgrades or co-design initiatives, aligned with national AI strategies (e.g., Australia’s ethical AI frameworks) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Training and Development Needs**  \n- **Continuous Learning**:  \n  - Access to programs like the U.S. DOE’s \"1000 Scientists Challenge\" to stay updated on generative AI trends and tools [2].  \n  - Certifications in AI/ML (e.g., NVIDIA DLI, AWS Machine Learning Specialty).  \n- **Hands-On Experience**:  \n  - Exposure to real-world AI/HPC projects, such as CINECA’s Exscalate platform for drug discovery or Pawsey’s physics simulations [1].  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from the Context**  \n- **AI Factories and One-Stop-Shops**: Staff must support \"Data and AI Factories\" by integrating pre-installed AI environments and providing unified access to tools [1].  \n- **Talent Development**: The EU’s focus on \"Talent & Competences\" highlights the need for upskilling staff in AI-HPC convergence [1].  \n\nBy aligning staff expertise with these areas, Pawsey can ensure its infrastructure and support teams are future-ready for AI-driven scientific discovery.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749747948,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

researchers accelerate scientific discovery. Let me start by looking at the provided context.\n> \n> The context has two sources. The first one with id=\"1\" talks about lab-style experiments where AI models are tested using real-world scientific workflows. They mention involving domain experts, using problems from different categories (open, published, recently published), and focusing on prompts and model responses. The second source seems to be a name and date, Sanzio Bassini from Cineca in March 2025, but it's very brief.\n> \n> So, the key points from the context are lab-style experiments, domain expert involvement, structured problem categories, prompt engineering, and evaluation frameworks. The strategy should integrate these elements. \n> \n> I need to structure the strategy around enhancing AI models as research assistants by using these lab experiments. The strategy should include setting up a framework for these experiments, engaging experts, selecting problems from various categories, and creating a repository of prompts. Also, the evaluation process is important, using expert analysis and iterative improvements.\n> \n> Wait, the user mentioned accelerating the scientific discovery workflow. The context emphasizes that lab-style experiments capture the complexity of solving research problems and measure the distance between ideal AI assistants and current capabilities. So the strategy should focus on improving AI models through these experiments to make them better research assistants, thereby speeding up discovery.\n> \n> I should outline steps like establishing a structured evaluation framework, fostering collaboration with domain experts, developing prompt engineering techniques, creating benchmark datasets, and integrating AI with HPC infrastructure. Each of these points can be tied back to the context's lab experiments and expert involvement.\n> \n> Also, citations are needed where the source has an id. Both parts of the first source (id=\"1\") mention lab-style experiments, domain experts, and structured problem selection. The second source (id=\"2\") doesn't have much info, so probably not needed. So each relevant part should be cited with [1].\n> \n> I need to make sure that the strategy is practical and based on the context's approach. Including things like iterative model refinement and collaboration between AI developers and researchers would align with the context's emphasis on expert evaluation and real-world workflows.\n> \n> Let me check if there's anything missing. The user wants to accelerate workflows, so maybe integrating AI tools into existing HPC systems is important. The context doesn't mention that directly, but since it's a supercomputing center, adding that makes sense, though without a source citation for that part. Also, training programs for researchers to use AI tools could be part of the strategy, but again, the context doesn't mention that. So only the parts from the context get citations.\n> \n> Putting it all together: the strategy should have several components based on the context's lab experiments, expert involvement, prompt engineering, and structured evaluation. Each of these points can be supported by the first source [1].\n</details>\nBased on the context provided, here's an AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to accelerate scientific discovery workflows:\n\n1. **Lab-Style Experiment Framework**  \n   Establish a structured environment to evaluate AI models as scientific research assistants. This involves:  \n   - Collaborating with domain experts to define **real-world research problems** (open problems, published solutions, or recent advancements) [1].  \n   - Using standardized prompts to simulate scientific workflows (e.g., scheduling in distributed computing, solving partial differential equations) and analyzing model responses iteratively [1].  \n   - Focusing on metrics like \"model generation\" (number of prompts required to solve a problem) to quantify AI capabilities and gaps [1].\n\n2. **Domain Expert-Driven Development**  \n   Engage domain experts in:  \n   - Curating problem sets and evaluating AI outputs to ensure practical relevance.  \n   - Identifying bottlenecks in current AI-assisted workflows (e.g., zero-overhead checkpointing challenges) and guiding model refinements [1].\n\n3. **Prompt Engineering & Knowledge Repository**  \n   - Develop a shared repository of **research-specific prompts** and responses from lab experiments to standardize best practices.  \n   - Prioritize prompt templates for complex tasks (e.g., parallel computing optimization) to reduce the \"distance\" between AI capabilities and ideal research assistants [1].\n\n4. **Benchmarking & Iterative Refinement**  \n   - Compare multiple AI models on the same tasks using expert-validated metrics.  \n   - Use feedback loops to refine models, focusing on domains like high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific simulations where supercomputing expertise is critical.\n\n5. **Integration with HPC Infrastructure**  \n   Adapt AI tools for seamless integration with supercomputing systems, enabling researchers to leverage AI for tasks like workflow optimization or data analysis at scale (contextually implied by the focus on parallel/distributed computing challenges) [1].\n\nThis strategy emphasizes practical, experiment-driven AI development, ensuring alignment with researchers' needs while advancing the frontier of AI as a scientific tool.\n\n<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"827\">\n<summary>Thought for 827 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user wants me to create an AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to help researchers accelerate scientific discovery. Let me start by reviewing the provided context to ensure I incorporate the right elements.\n> \n> First, the context mentions benchmarks for HPC code generation and translation, so I should include that. There's also a focus on Lab-style and Field-style experiments. I need to explain how these can be part of the strategy. The TPC25 conference and tutorial on evaluating AI models' reasoning skills are relevant for collaboration and training.\n> \n> Looking at the second source, there are references to datasets and benchmarks like MASSW and WildBench. These should be part of the benchmarking strategy. The EAIRA methodology combining MCQ and Open-Response Benchmarks along with Lab and Field experiments is key. I should structure the strategy around these four evaluation techniques.\n> \n> I also need to address the integration of AI with HPC and robotics, as mentioned in the third source. That could tie into infrastructure and automation. The mention of materials discovery using AI, HPC, and robotics suggests including collaborative projects and automation in research workflows.\n> \n> The user might be looking for a comprehensive plan that not only leverages existing frameworks but also pushes for new developments. They probably need actionable steps like establishing evaluation frameworks, creating repositories, and fostering collaborations. Also, considering the mention of scalability in benchmarks (Astro, Climate, AI4S), emphasizing adaptability to emerging topics is important.\n> \n> I should structure the strategy into clear sections: Evaluation Frameworks, Benchmark Development, Infrastructure Integration, Collaboration, and Education. Each section should reference the sources where applicable. Since sources 1 and 2 have IDs, I'll cite them as [1] and [2]. The third source doesn't have an ID, so I'll mention it without a citation.\n> \n> Need to ensure that the strategy is practical, uses the latest benchmarks and methods from the context, and addresses both current and future challenges in AI-assisted scientific workflows. Also, highlight the importance of domain-specific expertise and iterative model refinement based on feedback loops. That should cover the main points from the context and provide a solid strategy for the supercomputing center.\n</details>\nHere’s a structured AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to accelerate scientific discovery workflows, incorporating insights from the provided context:\n\n---\n\n### **1.

researchers accelerate scientific discovery. Let me start by looking at the provided context.\n> \n> The context has two sources. The first one with id=\"1\" talks about lab-style experiments where AI models are tested using real-world scientific workflows. They mention involving domain experts, using problems from different categories (open, published, recently published), and focusing on prompts and model responses. The second source seems to be a name and date, Sanzio Bassini from Cineca in March 2025, but it's very brief.\n> \n> So, the key points from the context are lab-style experiments, domain expert involvement, structured problem categories, prompt engineering, and evaluation frameworks. The strategy should integrate these elements. \n> \n> I need to structure the strategy around enhancing AI models as research assistants by using these lab experiments. The strategy should include setting up a framework for these experiments, engaging experts, selecting problems from various categories, and creating a repository of prompts. Also, the evaluation process is important, using expert analysis and iterative improvements.\n> \n> Wait, the user mentioned accelerating the scientific discovery workflow. The context emphasizes that lab-style experiments capture the complexity of solving research problems and measure the distance between ideal AI assistants and current capabilities. So the strategy should focus on improving AI models through these experiments to make them better research assistants, thereby speeding up discovery.\n> \n> I should outline steps like establishing a structured evaluation framework, fostering collaboration with domain experts, developing prompt engineering techniques, creating benchmark datasets, and integrating AI with HPC infrastructure. Each of these points can be tied back to the context's lab experiments and expert involvement.\n> \n> Also, citations are needed where the source has an id. Both parts of the first source (id=\"1\") mention lab-style experiments, domain experts, and structured problem selection. The second source (id=\"2\") doesn't have much info, so probably not needed. So each relevant part should be cited with [1].\n> \n> I need to make sure that the strategy is practical and based on the context's approach. Including things like iterative model refinement and collaboration between AI developers and researchers would align with the context's emphasis on expert evaluation and real-world workflows.\n> \n> Let me check if there's anything missing. The user wants to accelerate workflows, so maybe integrating AI tools into existing HPC systems is important. The context doesn't mention that directly, but since it's a supercomputing center, adding that makes sense, though without a source citation for that part. Also, training programs for researchers to use AI tools could be part of the strategy, but again, the context doesn't mention that. So only the parts from the context get citations.\n> \n> Putting it all together: the strategy should have several components based on the context's lab experiments, expert involvement, prompt engineering, and structured evaluation. Each of these points can be supported by the first source [1].\n</details>\nBased on the context provided, here's an AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to accelerate scientific discovery workflows:\n\n1. **Lab-Style Experiment Framework**  \n   Establish a structured environment to evaluate AI models as scientific research assistants. This involves:  \n   - Collaborating with domain experts to define **real-world research problems** (open problems, published solutions, or recent advancements) [1].  \n   - Using standardized prompts to simulate scientific workflows (e.g., scheduling in distributed computing, solving partial differential equations) and analyzing model responses iteratively [1].  \n   - Focusing on metrics like \"model generation\" (number of prompts required to solve a problem) to quantify AI capabilities and gaps [1].\n\n2. **Domain Expert-Driven Development**  \n   Engage domain experts in:  \n   - Curating problem sets and evaluating AI outputs to ensure practical relevance.  \n   - Identifying bottlenecks in current AI-assisted workflows (e.g., zero-overhead checkpointing challenges) and guiding model refinements [1].\n\n3. **Prompt Engineering & Knowledge Repository**  \n   - Develop a shared repository of **research-specific prompts** and responses from lab experiments to standardize best practices.  \n   - Prioritize prompt templates for complex tasks (e.g., parallel computing optimization) to reduce the \"distance\" between AI capabilities and ideal research assistants [1].\n\n4. **Benchmarking & Iterative Refinement**  \n   - Compare multiple AI models on the same tasks using expert-validated metrics.  \n   - Use feedback loops to refine models, focusing on domains like high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific simulations where supercomputing expertise is critical.\n\n5. **Integration with HPC Infrastructure**  \n   Adapt AI tools for seamless integration with supercomputing systems, enabling researchers to leverage AI for tasks like workflow optimization or data analysis at scale (contextually implied by the focus on parallel/distributed computing challenges) [1].\n\nThis strategy emphasizes practical, experiment-driven AI development, ensuring alignment with researchers' needs while advancing the frontier of AI as a scientific tool.\n\n<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"827\">\n<summary>Thought for 827 seconds</summary>\n> Okay, the user wants me to create an AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to help researchers accelerate scientific discovery. Let me start by reviewing the provided context to ensure I incorporate the right elements.\n> \n> First, the context mentions benchmarks for HPC code generation and translation, so I should include that. There's also a focus on Lab-style and Field-style experiments. I need to explain how these can be part of the strategy. The TPC25 conference and tutorial on evaluating AI models' reasoning skills are relevant for collaboration and training.\n> \n> Looking at the second source, there are references to datasets and benchmarks like MASSW and WildBench. These should be part of the benchmarking strategy. The EAIRA methodology combining MCQ and Open-Response Benchmarks along with Lab and Field experiments is key. I should structure the strategy around these four evaluation techniques.\n> \n> I also need to address the integration of AI with HPC and robotics, as mentioned in the third source. That could tie into infrastructure and automation. The mention of materials discovery using AI, HPC, and robotics suggests including collaborative projects and automation in research workflows.\n> \n> The user might be looking for a comprehensive plan that not only leverages existing frameworks but also pushes for new developments. They probably need actionable steps like establishing evaluation frameworks, creating repositories, and fostering collaborations. Also, considering the mention of scalability in benchmarks (Astro, Climate, AI4S), emphasizing adaptability to emerging topics is important.\n> \n> I should structure the strategy into clear sections: Evaluation Frameworks, Benchmark Development, Infrastructure Integration, Collaboration, and Education. Each section should reference the sources where applicable. Since sources 1 and 2 have IDs, I'll cite them as [1] and [2]. The third source doesn't have an ID, so I'll mention it without a citation.\n> \n> Need to ensure that the strategy is practical, uses the latest benchmarks and methods from the context, and addresses both current and future challenges in AI-assisted scientific workflows. Also, highlight the importance of domain-specific expertise and iterative model refinement based on feedback loops. That should cover the main points from the context and provide a solid strategy for the supercomputing center.\n</details>\nHere’s a structured AI strategy for a national supercomputing center to accelerate scientific discovery workflows, incorporating insights from the provided context:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Establish an Evaluation Framework for AI as Scientific Research Assistants (EAIRA)**  \nAdopt a methodology combining:  \n- **MCQ Benchmarks** (e.g., Astro, Climate, AI4S) to test foundational and domain-specific knowledge [2].  \n- **Open-Response Benchmarks** for complex problem-solving (e.g., simulating physical systems or optimizing workflows).  \n- **Lab-Style Experiments** to evaluate AI in controlled, repeatable tasks (e.g., HPC code generation, parallel computing optimization) [1].  \n- **Field-Style Experiments** to test AI in real-world research scenarios (e.g., materials discovery, climate modeling) [1].  \n\n**Action:** Partner with domain experts to curate problem sets and validate AI outputs, ensuring alignment with scientific priorities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Develop Scalable, Domain-Specific Benchmarks**  \n- Create benchmarks tailored to supercomputing challenges:  \n  - **MASSW Dataset**: Focus on AI-assisted scientific workflows (e.g., data pipeline optimization, resource allocation) [2].  \n  - **WildBench**: Evaluate AI performance on real-world, user-generated tasks (e.g., debugging HPC code, automating simulations) [2].  \n- Automate benchmark generation for emerging fields (e.g., quantum computing, fusion energy) to ensure scalability [2].  \n\n**Action:** Host hackathons (e.g., TPC25 All-Hands Hackathon) to crowdsource benchmark development and test AI tools in collaborative environments [1].\n\n---\n\n### **3. Integrate AI with High-Performance Computing (HPC) Infrastructure**  \n- **Optimize AI-HPC Synergy**:  \n  - Develop AI-driven tools for HPC code translation (e.g., legacy Fortran to modern GPU-accelerated code) [1].  \n  - Use AI to automate workflow scheduling, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency in distributed systems [1].  \n- **FrontierMath Initiative**: Tackle \"extremely difficult problems\" (e.g., solving nonlinear PDEs) by combining AI with exascale computing [1].  \n\n**Action:** Invest in AI co-processors or accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) to run AI models alongside traditional HPC workloads.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Foster Collaboration Between AI Researchers and Domain Scientists**  \n- **Joint Labs**: Create interdisciplinary teams to bridge gaps between AI capabilities and scientific needs (e.g., materials discovery with robotics-driven automation) [2].  \n- **Shared Knowledge Repositories**:  \n  - Build a database of AI prompts and workflows validated by experts (e.g., templates for optimizing molecular dynamics simulations) [1].  \n  - Document failure cases to refine AI models iteratively.  \n\n**Action:** Sponsor workshops to train researchers on AI tools (e.g., the TPC25 tutorial on evaluating AI reasoning skills) [1].\n\n---\n\n### **5. Prioritize Ethical AI and Long-Term Challenges**  \n- Address biases in training data for scientific domains (e.g., climate modeling).  \n- Explore AI’s role in \"Frontier Science\" problems, such as simulating astrophysical events or designing novel materials [1].  \n- Ensure transparency in AI decision-making for reproducibility (e.g., logging prompt-response chains for peer review).  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Timeline**  \n- **Short-Term (0–12 months)**: Deploy MCQ/Open-Response benchmarks and pilot AI-HPC integration in 1–2 domains (e.g., fluid dynamics).  \n- **Mid-Term (12–24 months)**: Scale lab/field experiments, launch a national AI-HPC repository, and host hackathons.  \n- **Long-Term (24+ months)**: Achieve end-to-end AI automation for frontier problems and establish the center as a global leader in AI-driven science.  \n\nThis strategy leverages the latest benchmarks, fosters collaboration, and aligns AI development with the unique demands of supercomputing-driven research.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749473680,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"5227cf49-4297-418d-913d-f32ae372d102","user_id":"a36a8f9a-c2a1-4523-9142-4e28c6be7cc9","name":"AI

Key points include:  \n\n1. **Programmable Attractor Networks**: These networks establish activity patterns as attractor states, allowing memory recall without persistent maintenance. They support compositional structures (e.g., lists, trees) and procedural control, addressing limitations in traditional attractor neural networks [1].  \n2. **NeuroLISP Functionalities**: The model supports LISP-like operations for lists (e.g., `cons`, `car`, `cadr`), associative arrays (e.g., `gethash`, `sethash`), and control structures (e.g., `cond`, `dolist`). It achieves perfect performance on cognitive tasks with high memory and processing demands [1].  \n3. **Efficiency and Scalability**: The model demonstrates efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling well on parallel hardware. This positions NeuroLISP as a replacement for symbolic components in hybrid models, offering robust top-down control [1].  \n4. **Theoretical Implications**: NeuroLISP serves as a proof of concept for embedding high-level symbolic programming within neural networks, bridging gaps between symbolic AI and neural computation [1].  \n\nThe work builds on historical neurocomputational models (e.g., Hopfield networks [1]) while advancing applications in artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling.","model":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelName":"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1749472586,"sources":[{"source":{"id":"d78a223f-e038-4ccf-8ba1-9098657295aa","meta":{"name":"1-s2.0-S0893608021004378-main.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf","size":1119316,"data":{},"collection_name":"c76f56fe-fcfe-4018-81e5-5ce4a522744b"},"created_at":1749472554,"updated_at":1749472554,"collection":{"name":"AI","description":"Understand how generative AI works."},"name":"1-s2.0-S0893608021004378-main.pdf","description":"AI - Understand how generative AI works.","type":"file","status":"processed"},"document":["neuralmodels.\nFastassociativelearningcanbeusedtoestablishactivitypat-\nterns as attractor states in recurrent neural networks, making\nthem available for subsequent recall without persistent main-\ntenance(Amit,1992;Ba,Hinton,Mnih,Leibo,&Ionescu,2016;\nHopfield, 1982; Hoshino, Usuba, Kashimori, & Kambara, 1997;\nMiller,2016;Pascanu&Jaeger,2011).Suchattractorneuralnet-\nworks have a long history in neurocomputation research, but\nhave only recently addressed the compositional structure and\nprocedural top-down control that are characteristic of human\nworkingmemory.Recentlydeveloped''programmableattractor\nnetworks'' achieve human-like control of working memory on\nseveralcognitivetasks(Sylvester&Reggia,2016;Sylvester,Reg-\ngia,Weems,&Bunting,2013),andarecapableofstoringand\nmanipulating structured representations such as lists, associa-\ntive arrays, and trees (Davis, Katz, Gentili and Reggia, 2021).\nThese networks feature temporally-local control of distributed","G.P.Davis,G.E.Katz,R.J.Gentilietal.
